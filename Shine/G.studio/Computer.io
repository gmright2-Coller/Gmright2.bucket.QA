When the Going Gets Tough, 
the Bard Goes Drinking* 



Hnd the going is tough 
. in Skara Brae town. 
The evil wizard Mangar , 
has cast an eternal winter 
spell. Monsters contro 
the streets and dun- 
geons beneath. Good 
citizens fear for their 
lives. What's worse, 
there's only one tavern 
left that serves wine. 
But the Bard knows 
no fear With his trusty 
harp and a few rowdy 
minstrel songs he claims

are magic, the Bard is ready 
to boogie. All he needs is 
a band of loyal followers: 
a light-fingered rogue to 
find secret doors, a 
couple of fighters 
to bash heads, a con- 
jurer to create weird 
allies, a magician for 
magic armor 
Then it's off to com- 
bat, as soon as the Bard 
finishes one more verse. 
Now what's a word that 
rhymes with "dead ogre?"

Let's face it. Buying home software can be a risky proposition. Good software costs a lot of money. 

Cheap software practically rolls over and barks. But look at this.The titles listed below are Electronic Arts' 

greatest hits. They've all scored on the "top twenty" best-seller charts. Between them they've won over 60 

product quality awards — making them the most honored products in the home software industry. 

Best of all, there's no longer any reason to swallow hard when you think about 

treating yourself to quality software. Because now you can:

Editor's Notes 



COMPUTE! Editor Tom Halfhill contrib- 
utes an editorial this month. 

— Robert Lock, Editor in Chief 

The latest-generation personal comput- 
ers present the best evidence to date 
that miCTOcomputers are evolving into 
desktop mainframes. Megabytes of 
memory, hard disk drives, high-speed 
processors, and multitasking operating 
systems are no longer limited to the 
monster machines locked away in the 
data processing departments of govern- 
ments and big corporations. Now you 
can get these features in a personal 
computer that costs less than $2,000 
and fits comfortably on a desktop. 

But why would you want to? After 
all, many people are questioning why 
anyone needs any kind of computer in 
their home. Are the new machines just 
a more blatant example of technological 
overkill? 

Practically everyone who's ever 
used a computer understands the value 
of more memory and mass storage, 
high-speed processing, and faster input/ 
output. All those things translate into 
more horsepower, and if the price is 
right, we'll welcome more horsepower. 
But one feature that some people are 
regarding with skepticism is multitask- 
ing — the ability to run more than one 
program at a time. Is it really practical 
to run a spreadsheet and a word proces- 
sor simultaneously? Even if the com- 
puter can do two things at once, the 
user probably can't. 

This criticism overlooks several ad- 
vantages of multitasking: its conven- 
ience, the way it shifts busy work away 
from the user and onto the computer, 
its implications for software design, and 
its future applications in tomorrow's 
homes. 

It's hard to appreciate the sheer 
convenience of multitasking until 
you've experienced it. Even if you 
aren't actively using two or more pro- 
grams at once, you can keep them load- 
ed in memory, available at the press of 
a key or click of a mouse button. For 
instance, you can type a letter with a 
word processor, switch to a terminal 
program to upload it to an electronic 
mail service, then switch to BASIC to 
finish a program you've been writing. 
On most home computers, that would 



require rebooting the machine several 
times, swapping disks, running differ- 
ent programs, and waiting. 

Multitasking can also spare you 
some drudgery by letting the computer 
do the tedious jobs. If you log onto a 
commercial information service to 
check stock quotations every evening, 
you can set up the computer to do this 
for you automatically — even while 
you're using the machine for something 
else in the meantime. Multitasking is 
something that's hard to do without 
once you've had it. 

Multitasking also lets you create 
your own integrated software pack- 
ages. You can buy whatever word pro- 
cessor, graphics program, spreadsheet, 
and terminal program you want and 
load them all into memory at once. If 
the computer supports a standardized 
file transfer protocol — as do the Macin- 
tosh and Amiga — you can cut and paste 
pictures or spreadsheet tables into doc- 
uments created with the word processor 
and so forth, even if the programs were 
made by different software companies. 

Finally, there are exciting possibili- 
ties for multitasking in the future. Re- 
member that microcomputers are 
following the paths established by 
mainframes; it's a small step from multi- 
tasking to multiuser processing. If a 
computer can run several programs at 
once in windows on a single screen, 
why not turn those windows into sepa- 
rate screens and put them in different 
rooms? We know from our mail and 
readership surveys that many of you 
are already multicomputer households. 
Mom and Dad have a computer in the 
study, and the kids have one or two in 
the family room or bedroom. Someday 
you'll be able to buy a single personal 
computer with enough brute force to 
drive several terminals throughout 
your home. Each terminal will be as 
powerful and seemingly as indepen- 
dent as today's personal computers, yet 
the system will be economical because 
you'll all share the same printer, modem, 
hard disk drive, and CD-ROM player. 

The main disadvantages of multi- 
tasking — the amounts of memory and 
processing time it can gobble up — are 
temporary annoyances. Memory chips 
are getting cheaper as fast as micro- 
processors are growing more powerful. 



Atari recently introduced the first 
1024K computer for under $1,000, just 
five years after an 8K Atari 800 retailed 
for $1,000. And Motorola recently an- 
nounced a 20 megahertz version of its 
68020 microprocessor, referred to as 
the "mainframe on a chip." 

It seems that the only real problem 
to be overcome is the incredible com- 
plexity of vrating and debugging a true 
multitasking operating system. Ask an 
IBM owner about all the popular Side- 
kick-type, co-resident programs that 
compete for the attention of DOS inter- 
rupts and the keyboard. Or ask an 
Amiga owner about the weird things 
that can happen when the computer 
tries to do too much at once. (In fact, 
one of the strangest things we've seen 
on the Amiga is something that can be 
described as a "half crash." On practi- 
cally any other computer, a system 
crash is a system crash — the machine 
locks up and you have no choice but to 
reboot. On the Amiga, we've managed 
to crash part of the computer while the 
other part struggles valiantly onward. 
You end up rebooting anyway just to 
play safe, but it's an interesting demon- 
stration of multitasking.) 

Essentially, multitasking gives you 
the near-equivalent of several comput- 
ers in a single box. And if the box is 
priced right and meets your other re- 
quirements, why walk when you can 
run?

40 Great Flight Simulator Adventures 

Charles Gulick 

Forty exciting, customized flight simulator scenarios put you in the 
pilot's seat as you fly over bridges, around skyscrapers, and land 
at mysterious airports. Flight Simulator (IBM PC) and Flight Simu- 
lator II (Apple II, Commodore 64, Atari) are two of the most popu- 
lar games/ simulations for personal computers. With this book, you 
can experience flight adventures from the moment you load the 
program. Parameters set up each flight and a running commentary 
describes what you'll see (and where to took to see it). Ranging 
from the simple and straightforward to the advanced and even 
mystical, these 40 flights will open a new dimension to an already 
outstanding program.

Relocating Machine 
Language 

I would like to combine two Commo- 
dore machine language programs that 
both reside at location 49152 ($CO0O). I 
know that BASIC lets you relocate pro- 
grams quite easily, just by moving the 
bottom-of-BASIC pointer upward. 
How is this done with ML programs? 
Richard Sands 

Machine language programs written for a 
6502-based computer are usually quite 
difficult to relocate. For instance, say that 
you have an ML program at $C000 which 
starts with these instructions: 

LDA $C030,X 
JSR SC200 
JMP $C400 

None of these instructions can be 
relocated unless you change the address 
contained in the instruction itself. The 
first (LDA $C030,X) retrieves one byte of 
data from a table beginning at location 
SCOiO (note thai the data lies within the 
program code). The JSR instruction works 
like GOSUB in BASIC, so JSR $C20Q goes 
to a subroutine located at SC200 and then 
returns. JMP works like GOTO in BASIC: 
JMP SC400 sends the computer straight to 
the segment of code located at SC400. 
Now say that you move the entire pro- 
gram down to location $8000. The in- 
struction JSR $C200 still sends the 
computer to $C200, but that address isn't 
within the program any more. To make 
the code work correctly at $8000, you'd 
have to change these three instructions to 
the following: 

LDA $8030,X 
JSR $8200 
JMP $8400 

That's not particularly difficult, and 
some machine language monitors even 
have a special command to make such 
adjustments automatically. However, you 
must be careful not to change addresses 



that refer to locations outside the 
program: 

JSR $FFD2 

This instruction calls the standard 
Commodore print-a-character routine, lo- 
cated in the computer's ROM. If you mis- 
takenly adjust this address along with all 
the internal address references, the result 
may be disastrous. Now let's look at a 
more difficult case: 

LDA ($FB),Y 

This instruction uses the powerful 
and very common indirect Y addressing 
mode, which refers irtdirectly to an ad- 
dress held in two successive zero page 
addresses (locations $FB-$FC in this case). 
There's no way to tell by looking at this 
instruction alone whether it refers to an 
area inside the program (and hence re- 
quires adjustment) or something external 
to the program code (in which case adjust- 
ment may be a mistake). You'll have to 
disassemble the program in its entirety, 
looking for other instructiojis that affect 
the contents of locations $FB-FC, either 
directly or indirectly. If this instruction is 
part of a general-purpose subroutine, you 
may find that it's called by many different 
parts of the program. Since free zero-page 
space is limited, you may also find that 
other subroutines re-use locations 
$FB-FC for an entirely different purpose. 
And while it's obvious that an instruction 
like STA $FB affects the contents of $FB, 
what about ROR $03,X or STA ($BO),Y? 
Those instructions might just as easily 
change the address held in $FB-FC. 

Once you've sorted out all the indi- 
rect addressing, you'll need to check for 
self-modifying routines — code that 
changes its own instructions while it rutis. 
When that's done, you'll have to interpret 
all the program's data and variable areas. 
For instance, say that you find the follow- 
ing hexadecimal values in a memory 
dump of the program code: 

93 05 20 a 54 OD 41 43 

These bytes could be virtually any- 
thing—sprite shape data, characters for a 
printed message, part of an internal dis- 
patch table, preset values for a bunch of 
unrelated variables, or even garbage that 
will be replaced with something meaning- 
ful when the program runs. While some 
programmers locate data areas at the end 
of the program, others sprinkle data and 



variables freely throughout the code. Un- 
til you find out exactly what purpose these 
bytes serve, there's no way to tell whether 
they need adjustment. This problem, more 
than any other, makes it impossible to 
write an "automatic ML relocator" that 
works correctly in every case. The reloca- 
tor would need to have as much intelli- 
gence as a knowledgeable ML programmer 
who thoroughly understands the subject 
program. 

These problems generally don't apply 
to 68000-based computers like the Amiga, 
Atari 520ST, and Macintosh. Since the 
computer tiormally decides for itself 
where to load the ML code, most 68000 
ML programs must be relocatable. That's 
no great hardship for programmers, since 
the 68000 instruction set includes many 
relocatable instructions.

Using Preview-80 With 64 
SpeedCalc 

I own a Commodore 64 and look for- 
ward to getting new programs from 
COMPUTE! each month, especially utili- 
ties. After typing in SpeedCalc (com- 
pute!, January 1985), I was pleased to 
find that the "Preview-80" program 
(COMPUTE!'s gazette, November 1985) 
works just as well with SpeedCalc as it 
does with SpeedScript. This lets you pre- 
view a SpeedCalc file in 80-column for- 
mat on the screen before printing it out. 
The procedure for using Preview-80 is 
the same as usual. First, load Preview- 
80 with LOAD"PREVIEW80",8,1. 
Then type NEW, and load SpeedCalc as 
you would normally. Instead of typing

WINTER games: ^ 
TI||4)UEST FOR THE GOLD CONTINUES... 





You've captured the gold in Summer 
Games® and Summer Games IP. Now 
it's on to the Winter Gamesl And what 
an incredible setting— a completely 
realistic winter wonderland featuring 
seven action-packed events. 

At the Ski Jump you control your 
form in mid-air, knees straight, leaning 
forward. Hot Dog Aerials challenges 
your courage and your sense of humor. 
In Figure Skating you leap into Double 
and TMpte Lutz jumps— wow the crowd 
with a perfect Camel into a Sit Spin. 
It's timing and style that counts. Free 
Skating lets you choreograph your own 
routines. In Speed Skating it's you 
against a fellow speed demon— the 
fastest human beings on level earth! 
And the Bobsled— still faster as you fly 
around hairpin turns, leaning hard to 
stay in the tube. Finally the Biathlon, 
the ultimate challenge to your endur- 
ance in cross-country skiing and 
marksmanship. 

All of this fun and excitement is 
easy to learn and play. You control the 



action with the joystick, animating your 
player for style and rhythm. You choose 
the country you want to represent. 
Listen to its national anthem. Then it's 
practice, training and learning a win- 
ning strategy for each event. Now the 
Opening Ceremony and the competi- 
tion begins— against your friends or 
the computer. Will you be the one who 
takes the gold at the Awards Ceremony? 
Will your name be etched amongst the 
World Record holders,' 

The quest for the gold continues... 
And it's all here— the strategy, the

Moving AmigaDOS 
Commands To RAM 

Regarding your article "Introduction to 
AmigaDOS" (COMPUTE!, January 1985), 
1 feel that it's inconvenient to have all of 
the AmigaDOS commands — especially 
often-used commands like DIR — stored 
on disk rather than in memory. Is it 
possible to load all or part of DOS into 
RAM? If so, how much memory does it 
take up? Can you write a batch file to 
make this part of the boot sequence? 
Will AmigaDOS become RAM-resident 
in the future? 

Barry Silverstein 

Evenf AmigaDOS command is disk-resi- 
dent, and you're not likely to see any 
change in the near future. This can be 
inconvenient at times since, for each sepa- 
rate AmigaDOS command, the computer 
has to access the same Workbench disk 
that zvas present when you booted the 
system. If you have only one disk drive, 
this scheme creates delays and requires 
extra disk-swapping. Fortunately, there's 
a simple remedy. If you create a RAM 
disk, you can then COPY any or all of the 
AmigaDOS commands from floppy disk to 
RAM disk; the amount of memory con- 
sumed depends on how many commands 
you copy. Once that's done, an ASSIGN 
command tells the system to use the 
RAM-resident commands. 

The most convenient way to move 
AmigaDOS commands into RAM is by 
editing the startup-sequence file, which 
is similar to an AUTOEXEC.BAT file in 
PC/DOS and MS/DOS systems. When 
you insert a disk in response to the Ami- 
ga's Workbench disk prompt, the com- 
puter looks in the S subdirectory of the 
currently mounted disk for a file named 
startup-sequence. If this file is present, 
the computer executes the AmigaDOS 
commands that it contains. Since startup- 
sequence is an ordinary ASCII text file, 
it's easy to modify with a word processor 
or any text editor that handles ASCII files. 
(Before editing this file, make sure that 
you have at least one copy of the Work- 
bench disk in addition to the one that 
came with your computer.) If you edit this 
file with Textcraft or some other word 
processor, you must resave it in the form 
of plain ASCII text, without special for- 
matting characters or control codes. 



AmigaDOS includes two text editors 
of its own. The easiest one to use is called 
ED. Type this line at the ClI prompt, then 
press RETURN: 
ed "s/slarlup-aequence" 

This command activates ED and 

loads startup-sequence into the editor. An 
unmodified startup-sequence file looks 
like this: 

ECHO "Workbench disk. Version 1.1" 

ECHO " " 

ECHO "Use Preferences tool to set date." 

ECHO " " 

LoadWb 

endcli > nil: 

You'll probably recognize the mes- 
sages that appear on the screen when you 
boot up with that disk. The LoadWb com- 
mand loads and activates the Workbench, 
and endcli terminates the AmigaDOS 
command sequence, returning you to the 
Workbench screen. We'll use ED to add 
some new command lines between 
LoadWb and endcli, ED is a very simple 
text editor: Use the cursor keys to move 
around in the file, and the BACKSPACE 
key to delete characters. Everything that 
you type is inserted at the current cursor 
position (you can use uppercase if you 
like, but lowercase works just as well and 
is easier to type). 

While you could copy the entire com- 
mand directory (named C) into the RAM- 
disk, that wastes a lot of RAM since some 
AmigaDOS commands are used only rare- 
ly. To save memory, we'll copy only the 
most commonly used commands. Place 
the cursor on top of the E in endcli and 
enter these lines, pressing RETURN at the 
end of each line: 

echo "Copying AmigaDOS commands to 

RAM disk..." 
copy c/copy ram:c/copy 
assign x: rantrc/copy 
assign d: rain:c 
cd sys:c 
x: assign d; 
x: cd d: 
x; copy d: 
x: delete d: 
x: dir d: 
x: diskcopy d: 
x: echo d: 
x: ed d: 
x: endcli d: 
x: info d: 
XI list d: 
x: makedir d: 
x: newdi d: 
x: rename d: 
x: run d: 
x: type d: 
cd sys: 

assign c: ram:c 
assign d: c:delete 

Remember, this set ofcomvtands goes 
between the LoadWb and endcli lines in 
the normal startup-sequence file. If you 
change your mind and don't want to mod- 
ify the file, press ESC-Q followed by RE- 



TURN; ED returns you to the CLI without 
changing anything. To save the modified 
file to disk, press ESC-X followed by RE- 
TURN. After the file is resaved, ED re- 
turns you to the CLI protnpt. To test the 
new startup-sequence file, reboot the 
computer by pressing CTRL-Lefl Amiga- 
Right Amiga. It takes about a minute to 
copy the com7nands shown above. Once 
the process is finished, all of the copied 
commands are instantly available in RAM 
(if this doesn't work, reload startup- 
sequence into ED and check for typing 
mistakes). 

The first command line following 
ECHO copies the COPY cotnmand itself 
into RAM so the computer can copy sub- 
sequent commands without accessing the 
disk each time. The next three lines sim- 
plify your typing job: The first ASSIGN 
command tells the computer to substitute 
the characters ram:c/copy wherever it 
sees the characters x:. The second AS- 
SIGN creates another short alias (d:) 
which stands for the pathname ramie. The 
CD command changes the current directo- 
ry to SYS:C so you won't need to specify a 
subdirectory for every file you want to 
move. These three shortcuts let you abbre- 
viate all of the remaitiing COPY com- 
mands (the command x: endcli d: becomes 
the equivalent of ram:c/copy sys:c/end- 
cli ram:c, and so on). 

Thus, each line beginning with x: 
causes the computer to copy a single Ami- 
gaDOS command to the RAM disk. Of 
course, you can delete commands from 
this list, or add others if desired. The 
command ASSIGN C: RAM:C tells the 
computer to use the C directory in the 
RAM disk as its command directory. From 
this point on, the Amiga searches the 
RAM disk when you tell it to execute an 
AmigaDOS command. The final ASSIGN 
command isn't really necessary, but 
shows how to create a shorthand name for 
an often-used command. In this case, 
we're creating d: as a synonym for DE- 
LETE. Once this is done, you can delete 
the file TEST by typing either DELETE 
TEST or D:TEST. This can be done for any 
command, using whatever shorthand you 
like. The command sequence shown here 
is adapted from an example in COM- 
PUTEl's AmigaDOS Reference Guide, 
which explains this and many other Ami- 
gaDOS topics in detail. 



HELP For Atari XL And XE 

I have an Atari 800XL and would like to 
know how to read the HELP key. 

R.E. Brock 

The status of the HELP key can be deter- 
mined by PEEKing location 732 on the 
Atari XL and XE computers. If the HELP 
key alone is pressed, this location returns 
a value of 17; when SHIFT and HELP are 
pressed simultaneously, it contains 81.

TAP THE POWER 

of the Commodore 128 



By the author of 
Machine Language 
for Beginners and 
Second 6oo/r of 
Mactiine Language 




128 Machine Language for Beginners 

Richard Mansfield 

One of the bestselling computer books ever has now been completely revised for the Commodore 128. 
Most commercial software is written in machine language because it's far faster and more versatile than BASIC. 
This new edition of Machine Language for Beginners is a step-by-step introduction to 8502 machine language 
programming on Commodore's 128 computer. 

The book includes everything you need to learn to effectively program the 128: numerous programming 
examples, memory management tutorials; a complete description of the many Kernal routines and other new 128 
features; numerous hints and programming techniques; and a dictionary of all major BASIC commands and their 
machine language equivalents. It also includes a high-speed, professional-quality, label-based assembler, 
optimized to take advantage of the speed and extra memory of the 128.

Like the other top-quality books from COMPUTEI, 128 Machine Language for Beginners brings you ready-to-use 
information in a clear, lively style that makes learning easy and enjoyable, whether you are a beginner or an ad- 
vanced computer user. 

An optional disk is also available which includes the assembler and example programs in the book. The 128 
LADS Disk is fully tested and ready to load on the Commodore 128. It costs only Si 2.95 and saves you hours of 
typing time.

Apple lle/llc Compaflbllfty 

I'm interested in buying an Apple lie 
computer. Can it use He hardware and 
software? 

Carlos Aguayo 

The Apple Ik computer is basically an 
Apple He that has been redesigned to take 
up as little space as possible. To keep the 
He small, Apple left out the He's expan- 
sion slots (where additional hardivare can 
be attached), but added a built-in 5V4-inch 
disk drive. They also put the most com- 
mon He expansion hardware (SO-column 
video display, an extra 6iK of memory, 
and two serial input/output ports) on the 
main board of the lie. In addition, the lie 
has some features that weren't available 
zuhen the He appeared: an advanced 
65C02 microprocessor and a character set 
called Mousetext which contains extra 
characters especially for Macintosh-style 
icon- and menu-based programs. The 
newest version of the He (called Enhanced 
lie) does have these extra features; dealers 
can upgrade an older lie at a small cost. 

The lie can run almost all lie pro- 
grams, as long as no special hardware is 
required. For instance, some music pro- 
grams can communicate with instruments 
through a MIDI (Musical Instrument Dig- 
ital Interface) adapter. This adapter must 
connect to an expansion slot, which is 
possible only on a lie. Other programs 
sometimes expect a parallel I/O interface 
to attach a printer. Since the lie has only 
serial I/O, it can't run that type of modifi- 
cation. Although the Ik has no expansion 
slots, its peripherals (serial ports, disk 
drives, etc.) act like they are built into 
certain slots. Apple tried to select the most 
commonly used slot for each peripheral 
(printer in slot 1, disk drive in slot 6). 
However, not everyone puts everything in 
the same place, and some programs may 
demand an unconventional configuration. 
lie owners can rearrange the cards in 
their slots to run such programs, but Ik 
owners don't have this option. 

The serial ports on the Ik generate 
standard RS-232 signals which can be 
used to communicate with most modems 
from any manufacturer. Many of the most 
popular printers are also available with 
RS-232 interfaces. But the Ik does not 
have standard connectors for these ports. 
To save space on the back panel of the 
computer, DIN-type connectors are used 
instead- as a result, you'll need special 
cables (available from Apple dealers) to 
attach serial peripherals. 

When it comes to expandability, the 
He IS much more flexible than the Ik. 
Almost any kind of peripheral can be 



attached through one of its slots, includ- 
ing parallel 1/0 ports, MIDI interfaces, 
hard disk drives, coprocessors, huge RAM 
expansion cards, and a host of other de- 
vices. However, some third-party compa- 
nies have begun modifying the Ik to put 
in extras like additional memory and Z80 
processors (to run the CP/M operating 
system, a popular He add-on). It's still 
more difficult than expanding a He, but it 
can be done. 

IBM PUT And GET 

I own a TI-99/4A and an IBM PCjr. 
Lately, I've been trying to convert some 
programs from TI to IBM. I have only 
one problem: the PUT and GET graphic 
statements in the IBM system. I really 
don't understand them. Could you 
show me a way to make an image and 
move it? 

Billy Mobley 

Firsf, be aware that IBM BASIC has two 
types of GET and PUT statements: one for 
graphics and another for random files. 
The syntax for each type is different, so be 
sure you're using the graphics type. GET 
grabs the screen image within a specified 
rectangle and stores a copy of it in an 
array. PUT does just the opposite, putting 
the image from an array back onto the 
screen. 

Several important rules apply to 
PUT and GET. Before using either com- 
mand, you must be in a graphics mode 
(SCREEN 1, for example); neither PUT nor 
GET works on a text screen. The array that 
you GET a shape into must be a one- 
dimensional numeric array dimensioned 
to the proper size. Finally, you must GET 
before you can PUT. 

The most difficult task is deciding 
what size to dimension the array. If the 
array is too small, it can't hold the graph- 
ics image, and the program won't work. 
The simplest solution is to try a large size 
like DIM A(500). It won't hurt to dimen- 
sion it larger than necessary, but this 
method wastes memory. Here's a more 
efficient formula that tells you the mini- 
mum required size for the array: 

INTH4 + INTWx'rcs + 7)/8)*y )/prec) 

In this formula, the variable x repre- 
sents the width of the image in pixels: y is 
the height of the image; res is 3 for high 
resolution and 2 for medium resolution; 
and prec is the precision of the array (2 for 
integer, 4 for single precision, and 8 for 
double precision). 

GET must be followed by the screen 
coordinates of two opposite comers of the 
rectangular image, and the name of the 
array. For example, GET (0,0)-(19,29),A 
grabs a 20 X 30 pixel image at the top-left 
corner of the screen and stores it in array 
A. (Of course, you must first have an 
image on the screen. This can be done 
with DRAW.) With a high-resolution 



screen and a single-precision array, the 
formula above gives 23, so the dimension 
statement would be DIM A(23). 

PUT is followed by the coordinates of 
the location on the screen where the top- 
left corner of the image is placed, then the 
name of the array, and an optional param- 
eter for special effects. Five special effects 
are available: PSET, PRESET, AND, OR, 
and XOR. If no special effect is specified, 
XOR is assumed. 

PSET displays the image exactly as it 
appeared when GET was used. PRESET 
displays a negative image. AND displays 
only those parts of the image that overlap 
an image already on the screen. OR super- 
imposes the image onto an image already 
on the screen. XOR is a combination of 
AND and PRESET, reversing only those 
parts of the image that overlap an image 
already on the screen. The best way to 
understand exactly what these special ef- 
fects do is to try them yourself. Using our 
example, PUT (200,W0),A,PSET displays 
the image stored in the A array in the 
center of the screen. 

The operation of XOR may seem 
strange, but it's handy for animation. 
When you PUT using XOR twice in the 
same position, the screen is restored un- 
changed. This allows you to move an 
image over a background image, giving a 
3-D effect. Animation with XOR is a 
three-step process: PUT the image on the 
screen with XOR, calculate the new posi- 
tion, PUT the image in the old position a 
second time to erase it. By performing 
these steps repeatedly, the image seems to 
move. The following program moves a ball 
across the screen.

Simpler Absent Printer Test 

I'm writing with regard to the "Readers' 
Feedback" item on absent Commodore 
printers, published in the December 
1985 COMPUTE!. Another way to avoid a 
DEVICE NOT PRESENT error is to ac- 
cess the appropriate device (4) through 
the command channel (15) and check 
the value of the status variable ST. If ST 
does not equal 0, then the printer is not 
present. Here is a short routine to 
demonstrate:

Thanks for this compact, all-BASIC solu- 
tion. In programs that open disk files or 
use att RS-232 device (usually a modem), 
you may want to perform this check at the 
very beginning, before you perform any 
other OPEN statements. The statement 
CLOSE 15 closes all other channels in 
addition to the command channel, termi- 
nating any RS-232 communications and 
disconnecting (but not really closing) any 
open disk files. 

Emphasized Tl Charocter Set 

The custoni character set given for the 
Commodore 64 on pages 108-109 of 
COMFUTEi's January 1986 issue can be 
used on the TI-99/4A with only slight 
modifications. Since that character defi- 
nition data is listed in hexadecimal for- 
mat, it can be read as a pattern-identifier 
string and assigned with the CALL 
CHAR statement (see page 11-76 in the 



TI User's Reference Guide). Each line in 
the Commodore character set listing 
contains data for a single character plus 
a checksum value at the end of the line. 
To convert the data in each line to a 16- 
character pattern -identifier string, type 
in the first eight two-digit hexadecimal 
numbers (spaces are left out, of course). 
In the first line, for instance, the result- 
ing string could be used with a CALL 
CHAR statement to redefine the @ 
character. To create the new character 
set, first enter this program: 

100 FOR L=l TO 94 

110 READ 0$ 

120 CALL CHAR(L+3 2,C5> 

130 PRINT CHR$(L+32); 

140 NEXT L 

150 GOTO 150 

Next, you must enter a series of 
lines containing DATA statements. 
Each DATA statement represents the 
data for one character in the form of a 
16-character pattern identifier string. 
For example, the first DATA line would 
look like this: 
500 DATA 7CC6DEDECOC07800 

Here is how to enter all of the 
DATA lines. 

lines 500-SOO Use data from line 
7108-71F8 (defines 



ASCII characters 33-63) 
line 810 Use data from line 7000 

(ASCII 64>

line 1090 Use OOC06O3018OC060O 

as data (ASCII 92) 
lines 1100-1110 Use data from lines 

70E8-70F0 (ASCII 

93-94) 
line 1120 Use OOOOOOOOOOOOOOFF 

as data (ASCII 95) 
line 1130 Use data from line 7200 

(ASCII 96) 
lines 1140-1390 Use data from lines 

7008-70DO (ASCII 

97-122) 
Unes 1400-1420 Enter data from lines 

72D8-72E8 (ASCII 

123-125) 
line 1430 Enter 000020745C080000 

as data (ASCII 126) 

The result of your effort will be an 

emphasized font with true lowercase.

OUR WORD FOR QUAUTT 



NEW TECHNOLOGIES 

The Converging Digital Universe 



Selby Boteman. Features Editor 



The winds of technological 
change have been blowing a 
gale for the past few years. And 
the forecast shows no indication of 
a letup. In fact, millions of consum- 
ers will begin to reap a resulting 
whirlwind of new high-tech prod- 
ucts for the home, office, and class- 
room. Consider the following: 

■ A home stereo system an- 
swers your phone, takes messages, 
and alerts you to incoming calls. 

• With the push of a button, 
your video film recorder captures a 
picture from your favorite TV show 
and instantly prints out a still photo 
for your wallet. 

• Your 20-volume set of ency- 
clopedias, contained and cross- 
indexed on a compact disc in a 
player connected to your computer, 
searches and prints out 37 reference 
sources on your selected topic in 
less than 30 seconds. 

• The satellite dish in your 
backyard automatically tracks vari- 
ous communication satellites based 
on the pattern of TV programs you 
want to watch each night. At the 
same time, your computer is receiv- 
ing and storing financial data that 
unobtrusively shares the same in- 
coming satellite transmission to 
your TV. 

• The digital TV in your living 
room displays two small windows 
on the screen while you watch a 



The digitization of America is well 
under way. Thanks to a wave of new 
consumer electrotiics products, this 
year more people than ever will see 
and hear how the convergence of digi- 
tal audio, video, satellite, telephone, 
optical, laser, television, and com- 
puter technologies is transforming the 
world. Yet, the phenomenon is just 
begimmig. 



program uninterrupted; one win- 
dow shows the changing stock quo- 
tations, while the second window 
displays a program from a different 
channel or previews a tape from 
your videocassette recorder. 

• The computer image recorder 
connected to your personal com- 
puter makes a 35 mm slide, color 
print, or overhead transparency of 
the business chart or digital paint- 
ing you've just created. 

Does any of this sound far- 
fetched? You'll be able to buy prod- 
ucts this year that do all of these 
things and more. If it seems difficult 
to keep up with the latest news 
about consumer electronics, it's not 
your fault. Never have so many 
dramatic technological changes 
produced so many new capabilities 
and products in so short a time. 
What has become strikingly clear is 
that ail of these innovations share a 



common foundation — the digital, 
microprocessor-based world of 
computer electronics. 

These changes have become so 
important to our lives and our 
pocketbooks that market re- 
searchers are now targeting a new 
group of consumers: Technologi- 
cally Advanced Families (TAFs). 
Could "yuppies" eventually be sur- 
passed in importance by "taffies," 
households that purchase and use 
the latest computers, VCRs, stereo 
TVs, 8 mm camcorders (camera re- 
corders), compact disc players, sat- 
ellite dishes, and dozens of other 
products? Consumer electronics 
manufacturers and retailers believe 
that these households are the im- 
portant leading-edge market for 
their array of new products. 

Among the catalysts sparking 
enthusiasm for the latest in high- 
tech gear, none is more important 
than the personal computer phe- 
nomenon of the past half-dozen 
years. Not only are computer own- 
ers the bedrock of the TAFs, but the 
new generation of 16/32-bit com- 
puters is powerful enough to work 
with just about any other consumer 
electronics product. Suddenly, de- 
vices like VCRs, compact disc play- 
ers, electronic keyboards, and 
camcorders have become computer 
peripherals. As these products con- 
tinue to become more sophisticated 

April 1966 COMPUTE! 21 



and flexible, their technologies con- 
verge and their capabilities expand. 
In the world of consumer electron- 
ics, the whole has indeed become 
more than the sum of its parts. 

The development of the micro- 
computer has accelerated an al- 
ready rapid evolution, says David 
Allen, president of Boston Media 
Consultants and a writer specializ- 
ing in TV production, computers, 
videodiscs, and videotape. "They 
come along with greater speed. 
That's not a function of any interac- 
tivity, that's just a curve that the 
computer industry and microelec- 
tronics industry are on. 

"Each development feeds the 
next development in a serendipi- 
tous way that makes succeeding de- 
velopments faster to accomplish," 
says Allen. "You can really say that 
we're now to the point at which 
you could almost create any tech- 
nological package you could con- 
ceive of, if you don't put a price 
restriction on it. Nothing is techno- 
logically impossible, in a broad 
sense. But it has to be accompanied 
by some kind of way to get return 
on investment. And that's what 
slows things down more than any- 
thing else right now. It's market- 
driven, not technologically driven." 

During the past year, a parade 
of new technologies has entered the 
computer scene. The arrival of 
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital 
Interface) has opened the doors to a 
new world of computer-based mu- 
sic composition and performance 
{see "Making Music with MIDI," 
COMPUTE!, January 1986). Laser- 
driven compact disc technology has 
branched out from stereo systems 
to computer data storage and re- 
trieval. Smaller, less expensive vid- 
eo cameras and camcorders that 
connect with VCRs and computers 
are making inroads in consumer 
markets. 

In addition, a new family of 
audio/video hardware and soft- 
ware products has been created to 
take advantage of the latest com- 
puters, particularly the Commo- 
dore Amiga, Atari ST, and Apple 
Macintosh. 

It's appropriate that in this age of 
video one of the most promising 
fields of development is com- 
puter control of video images that 
originate from video cameras, 

22 COMPUTEI April 1986 



VCRs, laser disc players, other com- 
puters, or TVs with video outputs — 
essentially any device that puts out 
a composite video signal. For in- 
stance, Commodore is releasing 
two fascinating video peripherals 
for the Amiga: the Genlock, which 
plugs into the back of the Amiga 
and mixes external video signals 
with the computer's own video out- 
put; and the Amiga LIVE digitizer 
(formerly known as the "frame 
grabber"), which captures and digi- 
tizes an external video image in the 
Amiga itself. 




Commodore /Amiga's Genlock accessory 
tucks beneath the rear of the Amiga 
computer and permits sophisticated 
video image mixing. 



"Genlock is external to the 
Amiga and externally mixes two 
video sources, one of them the 
Amiga's," explains Paul Higginbot- 
tom, an Amiga product manager at 
Commodore. "So you take the 
Amiga's video source and the exter- 
nal video source, and you combine 
them — and the audio as well. 
Nothing comes into the Amiga with 
Genlock. With Amiga LIVE, a digi- 
tized picture is brought into the 
Amiga. So one [Genlock] is doing 
superimposing, and the other 
[Amiga LIVE] is actually taking an 
image and bringing it in. 

"They operate separately, but 
you could certainly use them to- 
gether," says Higginbottom, "You 
may want to take a real image and 
put Amiga's graphics on it, and dig- 
itize those back into the Amiga 
again." 

Immediate applications for the 
Genlock include on-screen titling 
for video presentations or home 
movies, "electronic chalkboard" ef- 
fects similar to those used for TV 
sports analysis, and special video 
effects achieved by mixing Amiga 



graphics with other video images. 

At the Amiga's official unveiling in 
New York last summer, artist Andy 
Warhol used a video camera. Gen- 
lock, and Amiga LIVE to digitize a 
picture of rock singer Deborah Har- 
ry, then used a mouse-controlled 
graphics program to "paint" the 
video image with new colors. 
Amiga LIVE can be used not only 
for special video effects such as 
these, but also for video databases, 
says Higginbottom. 

"We don't just mean pretty 
pictures. If you're a real estate agent 
or an architect, or you have a parts 
list you want to inventory, some- 
thing like that — then you can have 
a video inventory," he explains. 
"And Amiga LIVE performs in real- 
time, not like most digitizers you 
see that usually take anywhere 
from 8 to 30 seconds to generate the 
picture on the screen. This is in 
realtime; if you have a movie cam- 
era, you'll see the image move as 
you move the camera." 

Both the Genlock and Amiga 
LIVE are expected to be available in 
April or May, pending final FCC 
approval. Each accessory will cost 
about $249.95. 

A different video digitizer is 
in the works for the Atari ST 
and should be available by 
the time you read this. Hippopota- 
mus Software is introducing the 
Hippovision Video Digitizer this 
spring for the ST and plans to have 
a version available later for the 
Amiga. (No price announced yet.) 
"Anything that produces video 
signals, you just plug into the [digi- 
tizer] box that's connected to the 
computer," says Clint Ballard, vice 
president of engineering for the Los 
Gatos, California firm. "You press a 
button when you get a picture you 
like, and there you have it. We'll 
also have image processing soft- 
ware with which you can change 
around the colors — do whatever 
you want with it. This really opens 
up the graphics world." 

For the Macintosh, which has a 
two-year head start on the Amiga 
and ST, there are already several 
video digitizers and compatible 
graphics programs available. Mac- 
Vision from Koala Technologies, 
Micro-lmager from Servidyne Sys- 
tems, Inc., Thunderscan from 
Thunderware, Inc., and a few others

HMMWATARL 



IT'S LIKE GETTING THE POWER AND SPEED OF A FERRARI 

FOR THE PRICE OF A FORD.' 



When Atari introduced the 520ST™, 
we set the personal computer industry 
on its ear. 

Nobody had ever produced a machine 
so powerful and technically advanced 
for such an incredibly low price. 
Nobody but Atari has done it yet. 

The competition was stunned. 

The critics wrote rave reviews. 

And consumers were ecstatic. 

We could have rested on our laurels^ 
but we didn't. 

Instead, Atari extended the ST concept 
to a new computer called the 1040ST '". 

The amazing new 1040ST is even 
more powerful than the 520ST and 
years ahead of all the competition at 
almost any price. The only question in

1986 isn't which 
company to buy 
a computer 
from, but which 
computer to buy 
from Atari. 

At S799, the 
520ST gives you 512 Kbytes of RAM, a 
high-resolution monochrome monitor, 
2-button mouse, and 3.5" disk drive. 

At $999, the 1040ST gives you 1024 
Kbytes of RAM, an ultra high- resolution 
monochrome monitor, 2-button mouse, 
and a built-in double-sided 35" disk 
drive, plus built-in power supply. Both 
the 520ST and the 1040ST can be con- 
nected directly to your own color TV 
Or you can add an Atari RGB color monitor 
to get the sharpest, most colorful images 
possible. Add $200 for color monitor. 

It's simply a matter of choosing which 
model best fits your needs. 

And whether you choose the 520ST 
or the 1040SX you'll be getting the 
power and speed of a Ferrari for the 
price of a Ford. 

In fact, you'll save hundreds and in 
some cases thousands of dollars over 
comparable computers. Which is why 
consumers are still ecstatic. Why the ' 
critics are still writing rave reviews. 
And why the competition is still stunned.

POWER WITHOUT THE PRICE: 



make excellent use of the Mac's 
high-resolution monochrome 
graphics. Smce the Amiga and the 
ST each boast superb color graphics 
as well as high-resolution modes 
surpassing the Mac's, video digiti- 
zation hardware and graphics soft- 
ware are becoming even more 
flexible and powerful. 

As computers grow more capa- 
ble of handling video images, other 
manufacturers are gearing up to 
take advantage of new markets ex- 
pected to develop. Toshiba and Po- 
laroid have announced products 
which strengthen the connections 
among computers, photography, 
and video. The two companies are 
jointly introducing a new instant 
video film recorder that produces 
instant color prints or slides from a 
TV set or monitor and has optional 
RGB (red-green-blue) computer in- 
put. The recorder features digital 
freeze-field capture, color preview 
capability, and accepts standard 
NTSC (National Television Stan- 
dards Committee) signals. 

The recorder captures and digi- 
tizes any image from a TV screen, 
whether the signal originated from 
a broadcast station, VCR, video 
camera, or any other standard vid- 
eo device. When equipped with the 
appropriate camera, the result is an 
instant photo print or 35 mm slide. 
With the push of a button, you 
could freeze one frame of your 
home movies, your favorite rock 
video, or a TV show, and then in- 
stantly produce a color picture. The 
recorder is expected to be available 
by midyear. 

Polaroid is also introducing 
this year an improved version of its 
Palette computer image recorder. 
The Palette provides presentation- 
quality photos from computer 
graphics generated by a wide vari- 
ety of computers, such as the Apple 
II series and the IBM PC family. It's 
capable of handling image resolu- 
tions up to 920 X 700, depending 
on the combination of hardware 
and software. Almost all presenta- 
tion-graphics and graphics-editing 
software is compatible with the 
under-$2,000 system. 

Although few personal com- 
puter owners will spend 
several thousand dollars to 
buy such video systems for the 
home, the next few years will see 

26 COMPUTEI April 19S6 



dramatic price drops as technology 
improves and costs decline. 

For example, Kodak's Con- 
sumer Electronics Division plans to 
introduce a still video system that 
allows you to select and record in- 
dividual video images. The sys- 
tem's player/recorder captures 
images in realtime from any NTSC 
video signal and stores up to 50 
images on a tiny floppy disk. An 
adjunct to this system is a film-to- 
disk transfer station that may be 
installed at film processors; you 
could have 35 mm color negatives 
transferred to the floppy disk, then 
view the pictures at home on your 
TV — ordering regular prints later, if 
you like. 

Kodak had also planned to an- 
nounce a new color video imager 
for producing instant prints of any 
video image. However, a recent de- 
cision by the U.S. Supreme Court 
on behalf of Polaroid has forced 
Kodak to withdraw from the instant 
photography business. Although 
Kodak had expected initial sales of 
the video imager to be in commer- 
cial and industrial applications, the 
iong-range plan was to make the 
product part of home computer and 
video centers, according to Richard 
D. Lorbach, vice president of Ko- 
dak's consumer division. 

"We anticipate that the color 
video imager eventually will be 
used as a home entertainment cen- 
ter component," said Lorbach 
before the court decision was hand- 
ed down. "Our market research in- 
dicates that there is significant 
consumer interest in being able to 
make photographs of personal im- 
ages displayed on TV screens." 

This type of video system pre- 
sents a wide range of possibilities. 
For example, by capturing images 
from your home videos, you could 
make a slide show of still shots or 
produce prints or slides for family 
albums. Computer artists could 
take their digital paintings or im- 
ages captured from a video source 
and create their own sequenced 
video show. With the appropriate 
computer software, text could be 
overlayed on any of the images. 

There are hundreds of business 
and industrial applications for this 
technology. Rather than spending 
thousands of dollars on outside 
production of sales and marketing 
presentations, almost any business 



would have access to high-quality 
video production. A real estate 
agency could take photos or video- 
tapes of its properties, add textual 
information on prices and other de- 
tails, and then show the resulting 
package to their customers. Any of 
the frames could be turned into 
glossy prints for the house-hunters 
to keep for reference. The ramifica- 
tions are virtually limitless. 

One of the most important 
developments in the mar- 
riage of computer and vid- 
eo technology is the introduction of 
digital TVs — TV sets that convert 
the incoming analog broadcast sig- 
nal into digital form. Toshiba, 
Sony, and most of the other large 
consumer electronics companies 
have invested millions of dollars to 
develop digital TV. Exceptionally 
clear pictures are only one of the 
benefits of this research. Digital 
TVs also have what's called PIP 
(picture-in-picture) capability — 
they can partition the viewing 
screen by opening separate "win- 
dows" for simultaneously display- 
ing other video signals. 

An example is the 26-inch DT- 
2680A TV receiver/monitor from 
NEC Home Electronics. It can si- 
multaneously display the picture 
from the station that's tuned in plus 
moving pictures from any of three 
auxiliary video inputs, or color 
computer graphics through the set's 
RGB input. You can watch two 
channels at once, or a channel and a 
videotape, or even work with your 
home computer while watching TV 
on the same screen. 

The picture you'll be watching 
is much sharper, too. Today's con- 
ventional TVs offer approximately 
250 lines of horizontal screen reso- 
lution, while the NEC digital TV is 
capable of resolving up to 500 lines. 
This is actually more resolution 
than is available from broadcast 
signals. Through special filtering, 
the digital TV displays a broadcast 
screen resolution of 336 lines — the 
best that's possible with today's 
broadcasts. 

In addition, the NEC digital TV 
has enough microprocessor-based 
memory to store up to three differ- 
ent still video pictures at a time. By 
pressing a button on the remote 
control, you can capture any video 
image and display it as an SVi-inch

(diagonal) window within the 26- 
inch screen. Meanwhile, the back- 
ground video image is unaffected. 
You could freeze-frame a fullback 
plowing through the line while 
watching the play continue on the 
main screen. 

As might be expected, the con- 
nection capabilities and special fea- 
tures of such a TV set go far beyond 
the few video and audio plugs 
found on even the better current 
sets. The NEC digital TV contains a 
stereo amplifier and stereo speak- 
ers, three sets of line video inputs 
for VCRs, video disc players, color 
cameras, and home computers, and 
an eight-pin RGB input. Outputs 
include a monitor jack that carries 
whatever is on the screen, a TV 
output that carries whatever chan- 
nel is tuned, external speaker out- 
puts, fixed audio line outputs for 
recording, and variable audio line 
outputs for volume-controlled con- 
nections to an external sound 
system. 

As NEC vice president Gerry 
Tangney says, this "is a taste of the 
future of home TV." The NEC digi- 
tal set is expected to be introduced 
in May, with the price to be an- 
nounced soon. 

Another new technology al- 
ready on the horizon is high-defini- 
tion TV (HDTV), an enhanced 
broadcast signal that offers 1,125 
scan lines of information instead of 
the 525 now used in conventional 
American TV broadcasting. This 
would require broadcasters to up- 
grade their equipment, however, 
and efforts to adopt an HDTV stan- 
dard have reportedly been mired in 
international and corporate dis- 
agreements over how to bring 
about this doubling of screen 
clarity. 

The growing popularity of com- 
pact disc (CD) audio players 
has given new impetus to the 
development and widespread con- 
sumer distribution of their digital 
data cousins, called CD-ROMs 
(Compact Disc-Read Only Memo- 
ries). Although these laser discs are 
only 4.72 inches in diameter, they 
are capable of storing 600 mega- 
bytes of information on a single 
side, with an access time of 
seconds. 

The first company out the door 
with CD-ROM players in the retail 

28 COMPUTEl April 1986 



market is the Subsystems and Peri- 
pherals Division of North Ameri- 
can Philips Corporation. Its CM 100 
disc player and CM 155 controller 
card works with the IBM PC- 
compatible computers (other inter- 
faces will be announced this year). 
Available with the Philips CD- 
ROM player is Grolier's The Elec- 
tronic Encyclopedia, the equivalent 
of a 20-volume reference collection 
on just about a quarter of one side 
of a CD-ROM disc. Although the 
initial purchase price of $1,495 may 
keep initial sales out of the home 
market in volume, the price for CD- 
ROM technology is expected to 
drop quickly over the next couple of 
years. 




Philips has introduced its CD-ROM 
drive which comes zvith Grolier's Elec- 
tronic Encyclopedia on a compact disc. 
The entire package sells for $1,495. 

Technology occasionally 
moves in mysterious ways, and an 
example can be seen in new prod- 
ucts which have taken advantage of 
the popularity — and intimidation — 
of word processors. Casio's new 
CW-30 Personal Typewriter blends 
the comforting familiarity of a type- 
writer with the ease of use of a 
computer word processor. The 
$399.95 hybrid machine looks very 
much like a standard electric type- 
writer. But a quick look at the key- 




This Casio computer-compatible elec- 
tronic typewriter is a hybrid — part type- 
writer and part word processor — that 
can connect to a computer to serve as a 
printer. 



board also shows a set of cursor and 
special function keys, plus a 15- 
character liquid-crystal display 
window for editing. 

One of the most interesting 
features of the Casio typewriter is 
that it's computer-compatible. It 
contains both a Centronics- 
standard parallel interface and an 
RS-232 serial interface that lets the 
typewriter become a computer 
printer (plain or thermal paper). It 
can be hooked up to a 300 baud 
modem for uploading and down- 
loading text with a computer. It has 
built-in pica and elite pitches, right 
justification, and multiple type 
fonts: boldface, underlining, dou- 
ble-wide characters, special sym- 
bols, and foreign alphabet 
characters. It has enough memory 
to store two pages of text, and with 
an optional memory expander, up 
to ten pages of text. Small remov- 
able memory cards let you save and 
store text. Casio obviously hopes to 
capture the best of both worlds, 
typewriters and word processors, at 
the same time it is attracting those 
who don't want to give up type- 
writers, but are fearful they're being 
left behind by word processors. 




The Magnavox VideoWriter is an $800 
dedicated word processor aimed at the 
home market. 

Magnavox has taken a differ- 
ent approach with its new Video- 
writer, a dedicated home word 
processor that contains its own soft- 
ware, printer, spelling checker, and 
18-line monitor (smaller than a reg- 
ular computer screen, but larger 
than most portable computers). The 
$800 Videowriter has a memory ca- 
pacity of approximately 70 pages of 
text, automatically stored on stan- 
dard 3V2-inch disks. While dedicat- 
ed word processors have been used 
in offices for years, it's unusual to 



see such a product for the home 
market, especially considering the 
number of people who buy multi- 
purpose computers primarily for 
word processing. 

Computers are converging 
with yet another technology, too — 
telephones. For example. Commo- 
dore is planning to introduce its 
new 1100 AnswerMate, a program- 
mable computer-controlled tele- 
phone answering machine for the 
Amiga. The AnswerMate connects 
to the Amiga's RS-232 port and to a 
telephone. Not only does it play 
back your taped greetings and re- 
cord messages, but it also can re- 
spond with messages generated by 
the Amiga's built-in synthesized 
voice. And multitasking software 
included with the AnswerMate lets 
it answer phone calls while you're 
busy using the computer for other 
things. (Price to be announced.) 




Commodore's AnswerMate connects to 
the Amiga computer to serve as a tele- 
phone answering machine that can make 
use of the Amiga's multiprocessing and 
synthesized speech capability. 



There is scarcely an area of con- 
sumer electronics which is not 
moving either directly or indi- 
rectly toward the personal com- 
puter, either as a peripheral or as a 
microprocessor-based stand-alone 
device. Even the ways in which 
computer users receive their soft- 
ware may be undergoing change in 
the future. 

For example, Cauzin Systems, 
with backing from Kodak, has de- 
veloped the Softstrip system of 
information storage. Data is en- 
coded on a strip of paper in a format 
similar to — but more compact 
than — the familiar bar codes found 



on consumer products. One strip, 
which typically measures 9V2 by % 
inches, can store up to 5,500 char- 
acters (about three typewritten 
pages). The strips can be printed on 
ordinary paper and are read by an 
electro-optical scanner. Connected 
to a computer, the scanner reads 
the coded strips and transfers the 
data into memory for later storage 
on disk. 

Further examples of converg- 
ing electronics technologies abound 
in virtually every field. The emer- 
gence of stereo TVs and VCRs, cou- 
pled with a stereo-capable 
computer such as the Amiga, obvi- 
ously opens new possibilities for 
audiophiles. Interactive video, 
spurred by improvements in laser 
discs, is another rapidly evolving 
technology with a connection to 
personal computing. Radio signals 
relayed by satellites can carry data 
accessible by computer users. Use 
of electronic mail systems is expect- 
ed to jump from less than a billion 
messages a year today to more than 
20 billion by the end of the decade, 
ultimately becoming a major ser- 
vice as common as the telephone 
and the U.S. mails. 

As media consultant David Al- 
len noted earlier, technology is ca- 
pable of virtually anything today; 
but the successful marketing of an 
idea is the key to its success. In the 
forseeable future, neither technol- 
ogy nor the marketplace shows any 
signs of slowing down. &

Report From: 

The Winter Consumer Electronics Show 



A Turning Point 
For Atari? 




Tom R. Halfhill, Editor 

Following up its strong showing at the 
Comdex computer show in November, Atari 
introduced a more powerful version of its ST 
at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 
January. Thanks to increasing sales, growing 
software support, widening distribution, and 
hints of new enhancements to come, industry 
watchers are suddenly taking more notice of 
Atari's hid for a comeback. Meanwhile, 
Commodore also entered 1986 with 
encouraging sales and Apple 
is responding with an 
improved Macintosh and 
lower prices. 



30 COMPUTE! April 1966 



A year ago it seemed impossi- 
ble. Commodore founder 
Jack Tramiel had split with 
his successful computer company 
after a management dispute, 
bought the debt-ridden Atari that 
he had nearly destroyed in price 
wars, installed his sons in key posi- 
tions, laid off most of the work 
force, rushed the design of a power- 
ful 16/32-bit machine in 
only six months, intro- 
duced it at an unheard- 
of low price, and 
announced he was go- 
ing to resurrect Atari as a 
major contender in the 
personal computer 
marketplace. 

Atari still isn't 
home free. But the house 
that Jack built suddenly 
seems a lot more solid. 
Strengthened by 
encouraging sales of the 
520ST — according to es- 
timates, at least 100,000 
units worldwide through 
Christmas — Atari is now 
attracting more attention 
within the industry. 
"Frankly, a lot of people 
didn't think Jack would 
make it this far," says one 
observer. "Now they're 




The new Atari 1040ST is the first one- 
megabyte computer for under $1,000. It 
has 1,024K of RAM and a built-in, dou- 
ble-sided disk drive. 



taking him a lot more seriously." 
If Atari's comeback ultimately 
succeeds, the six-week period be- 
tween late November 1985 and ear- 
ly January 1986 may well become 
recognized as the turning point. 
During that period. Atari piled up 
sizeable holiday sales and made 
impressive appearances at two cru- 
cial industry trade shows: Fall 
Comdex and the Winter Consumer 
Electronics Show. Both are held an- 
nually in Las Vegas and are among 
the largest trade shows in the U.S., 
with upwards of 100,000 people at 
each event. 

At Comdex, which is oriented 
toward business computing. Atari 
demonstrated to skeptics that its 
520ST was a real machine with 
dozens of software packages. At 
CES, a show that encompasses ev- 
ery consumer electronics product 
imaginable, Atari was the only ma- 
jor computer manufacturer in 
attendance and made three impor- 
tant announcements: the new 
1040ST, a more powerful version of 
the 520ST with one megabyte of 
memory and a built-in disk drive- 
price reductions of $100 for the 
monochrome and color 520ST sys- 
tems; and a shift to mass-market 
outlets such as department stores 
for the 520ST. 

Atari's appearances at Comdex 
and CES seemed all the more im- 
pressive due to the conspicuous ab- 
sence of its closest competitor. 
Commodore. People were surprised 
when Commodore missed Comdex 
because the company has been try- 
ing to position the Amiga as a busi- 
ness computer and Comdex was the 
ideal place. But there was shock 
when Commodore bowed out of 
CES because Commodore has never 
missed a CES since the days when 
wristwatches and calculators were 
its stock in trade. 



Commodore didn't have much 
to say about missing the shows. 
However, one Commodore execu- 
tive admitted he was "uneasy" 
about the reaction at CES — ironi- 
cally, the rumors of imminent fi- 
nancial catastrophe that once 
followed Atari were now being 
whispered about Commodore. The 
rumors proved untrue, however, 
and Commodore says it definitely 
plans to attend the Summer CES in 
Chicago this June. 

Actually, Commodore finished 
1985 with heavy sales of its own. 
According to reliable estimates. 
Commodore sold about one million 
64s, as many as 500,000 Commo- 
dore 128s, and at least 20,000 Ami- 
gas. Even Commodore was caught 
off guard by the 64 and 128 sales. In 
fact, insiders say Commodore tried 
twice during the fall to discontinue 
the 64, but had to restart production 
both times to meet sudden demand. 
As an indication that Amiga sales 
are healthy, the leading indepen- 
dent software supplier for the com- 
puter — Electronic Arts — says it re- 
covered all of its 1985 Amiga devel- 
opment costs within two weeks after 
releasing its first Amiga products. 

Although Atari and Commo- 
dore are still struggling financially, 
both have survived a rough market 
in 1985 and appear to be in better 
shape for 1986. 

Since Atari was the only ma- 
jor computer company ex- 
hibiting at CES (IBM and 
Apple routinely avoid this show), 
most of the computer news was 
Atari-related. The main event was 
the introduction of the 1040ST, the 
first one-megabyte computer sell- 
ing for under $2,500. In fact, it's the 
first one -megabyte computer sell- 
ing for under $1,000. 

April 1966 COMPUTB 31 



The 1040ST is basically an en- 
hanced 520ST and is fully compati- 
ble with existing ST software and 
hardware. The keyboard and all in- 
terfaces are identical: RS-232 serial 
and Centronics-standard parallel 
ports; in/out MIDI (Musical Instru- 
ment Digital Interface); floppy and 
hard disk interfaces; plus mono- 
chrome and analog RGB monitor 
outputs. The graphics-oriented user 
interface, GEM (Graphics Environ- 
ment Manager), is the same. 

New features on the 1040ST 
include one megabyte (1,024K) of 
Random Access Memory (RAM), 
twice the amount that comes with 
the 520ST; a built-in, double-sided 
SVi-inch disk drive with a capacity 
of 770K per disk, twice the capacity 
of the drive sold with the 520ST; a 
TV output jack; and an internal 
power supply for both the com- 
puter and drive, reducing the famil- 
iar clutter of external cables. 

Like recent-model 520ST5, the 
1040ST comes with its Tramiel Op- 
erating System (TOS) in Read Only 
Memory (ROM) chips, freeing up 
more than 200K RAM that used to 
be required when loading TOS 
from disk. Also like the 520ST, the 
1040ST comes with ST BASIC, the 
NEOchrome graphics -drawing pro- 
gram, and a word processor, 1st 
Word (the 520ST comes with ST 
Writer). Atari says 1st Word has 
GEM features such as drop-down 
menus and on-screen type fonts. 
{ST Writer, by contrast, is a direct 
translation from the AtariWriter 
word processor for eight-bit Ataris.) 

There are two different 1040ST 
packages. With a high-resolution 
monochrome monitor, the suggest- 
ed retail price is S999.95, With an 
analog RGB color monitor, the price 
is $1,199.95. Atari says the 1040ST 
will be sold only through computer 
dealers and should be available 
immediately. 

The 520ST also underwent 
some minor changes. The 
latest models will be shipped 
with TOS in ROM and a TV output 
jack. To widen distribution, the 
520ST will be sold through mass- 
market outlets in three different 
ways. A system that includes the 
computer, a single-sided 3V2-inch 
disk drive (380K capacity), and hi- 
res monochrome monitor will now 

32 COMPUTE! April 1986 



be priced at $699 suggested retail. 
The same system with an analog 
RGB color monitor instead of the 
monochrome screen will be priced 
at $899. Both prices are $100 lower 
than before. The 520ST compo- 
nents are also available separately: 
$399 for the computer, $199 for a 
single-sided drive, $299 for a dou- 
ble-sided drive, $199 for the mono- 
chrome monitor, and $299 for the 
RGB monitor. 



by lining up a series of computers 
running the now-famous Amiga 
bouncing ball demo. (A screen pho- 
to of this demo appears in COM- 
PUTEf's cover story on the Amiga in 
September 1985; it shows a red- 
and-white checkered globe spin- 
ning and bouncing around the 
screen, casting a transparent shad- 
ow on the background.) An Amiga, 
520ST, Macintosh, and eight-bit 
Atari 130XE spent four straight

Atari's 520ST has been improved with a ROM-based operating system, a TV output 
jack, and a $100 lower price. Also, for the first time, the computer and other 
components tvill be available separately in mass-market outlets. 



Rumors abounded at CES 
about new developments for the ST 
line, including a better graphics 
chip, a bit-block transfer chip simi- 
lar to the one in the Amiga, a 5'/*- 
inch disk drive adapter for use with 
an IBM PC emulator, and more. 
Officially, Atari won't confirm or 
deny if it's preparing to introduce 
any of these products in the near 
future. 

However, Atari is expected to 
announce at least one enhancement 
at an upcoming computer show in 
West Germany (about half of all ST 
sales are in Europe). The most like- 
ly possibility is the bit-block chip, 
which allows faster screen graph- 
ics. Also, it is now known that three 
companies outside Atari are work- 
ing on PC emulators for the ST, 
each taking a slightly different ap- 
proach. At this writing (mid-Janu- 
ary), none of them is expected to be 
ready for several months. 

Atari's CES exhibit poked fun 
at the Amiga and Apple Macintosh 



days dribbling checkered balls at 
the Atari booth. Oddly enough, the 
130XE version was perhaps the 
most impressive of all. Not only 
was the 130XE bouncing a checker- 
ed ball, but also a 3-D image of the 
Atari logo decorated with 128 rip- 
pling colors. 

Apple hasn't been oblivious to 
the competition, and a week after 
CES announced an improved ver- 
sion of the Macintosh and lower 
prices for the 512K Mac. The new 
Macintosh Plus has one megabyte 
of RAM, a double-sided disk drive 
that stores 800K (twice the capacity 
of existing Macintosh drives), a re- 
designed keyboard with numeric 
keypad and cursor keys, a faster 
operating system, and an extra pe- 
ripheral port called the Small Com- 
puter System Interface. The 
suggested retail price is $2,599. The 
512K Mac was reduced from $2,499 
to $1,999, and kits are available so 
owners of 128K and 512K Macs can 
upgrade to the Mac Plus.

Atari didn't ignore its older 
products at CES. Among 
other things, two new 
eight-bit computer packages were 
unveiled. 

The 130XE, a 400/800/XL- 
compatible computer with 128K 
RAM that was introduced last year, 
will now be available in a $399 
package that includes a 1050 disk 
drive, 1027 printer, and five pieces 
of software: AtariWriter, Music 
Painter, Paint, Star Raiders, and Si- 
lent Butler. The 130XE is still avail- 
able separately for $149. 

Atari's new lowest-end com- 
puter is the 65XE, a 400/800/XL- 
compatible machine with 64K 




Relics from another age? Nope. Video- 
game machines are still selling so well 
that Atari has redesigned the nine-year- 
old 2600 and introduced a new model, 
the 7800. 



RAM. It was actually announced at 
last year's Winter CES, but was 
withheld from the market until ex- 
isting inventories of 800s and 
800XLS were sold out. The 65XE 
will be sold separately for under 
$100 or in a package similar to the 
laOXE's for $300-$350. 

Much to everyone's surprise. 
Atari also came to CES with a rede- 
signed 2600 videogame machine 
(formerly known as the VC5) and 
the new 7800 game machine. 
What's that, you thought video- 
game machines were dead? Guess 
again. Atari says it sold over a mil- 
lion 2600s in 1985. Apparently 
many of them are going to new 
markets overseas — including, we 
hear, the People's Republic of 
China. 

34 COMPUTEI April 1986 



The revamped 2600 is smaller, 
lighter, sleeker, has a carrying han- 
dle, and costs less than $50. The 
7800 machine was one of the last 
projects of the old Atari before Tra- 
miel took over, and is now being 
unpacked from mothballs. Thanks 
to a chip named MARIA, the 7800's 
graphics are superior even to those 
of the eight-bit computers, and the 
machine accepts all 2600 cartridges 
without an adapter. It sells for less 
than $80 and comes with a new 
version of Pole Position, the hit car 
racing game. 

Computers aren't much good 
without software, and Win- 
ter CES demonstrated that a 
lot of companies are bringing out 
new programs for the ST and 
Amiga as well as popular eight-bit 
machines. Unfortunately, there 
were a lot fewer software compa- 
nies at this CES than last year's. 
The West Hall, a large building 
which supplements the main Con- 
vention Center, once was filled 
with software publishers. This year, 
only a handful of them shared 
space with companies selling satel- 
lite dishes, videotapes, cable TV ac- 
cessories, and other periphernalia. 
The last two years have been tough, 
and many software developers 
either can't afford to exhibit at CES 
anymore or are out of business 
altogether. 

Still, some fascinating products 
are on the way. Starting with ST and 
Amiga software, here's what's new: 

Electronic Arts (San Mateo, 
California) announced several new 
programs for the Amiga and its first 
products for the Atari ST. New 
Amiga software slated for release 
this year includes Deluxe Music, a 
note-oriented composition pro- 
gram; Instant Music, a composition 
program for nonmusicians; Arctic- 
fox, a strategic combat tank simula- 
tion; /Irfuejjfure Construction Set, for 
do-it-yourself adventure games; and 
Deluxe Printing Construction Set. 

A previously announced Elec- 
tronic Arts program. Deluxe Video 
Construction Set, is due for release 
soon. It lets you create animated 
sequences that can be integrated 
with screens created in DeluxePaint, 
a drawing program released in De- 
cember. (Electronic Arts says it 




Arcticfox is a new strategic tank game 
for the Amiga from Electronic Arts. 




This is the Amiga version o/ Marble 
Madness, but Electronic Arts is also 
bringing out an Atari ST version of the

NRI Trains You At Home— As You BuUd Your Own IBM-Compatible Computer 

GET THE KNOW-HOW 

TO REPAIR EVERY 

COMPUTER ON THIS PAGE. 



Learn the Basics the NRI 
Way-and Earn Good 
Money Troubleshooting 
Any Brand of Computer 

The biggest growth in jobs 
between now and 1995, according 
to Department of Labor estimates, 
will occur in the computer service and 
repair business, where demand 
for trained technicians will 
actually double. 

You can cash in on this 
opportunity— either as a 
fulitime corporate technician 
or an independent service- 
person— once you've learned 
all the basics of computers the 
NRI way. iNRI's practical 
combination of "reason-why" 
theory and "hands-on" building 
skills starts you with the hindamentais 
of electronics, then guides you through 
advanced electronic circuitry and on 
into computer electronics. You also 
learn to program in BASIC and machine 
language, the essential languages for 
troubleshooting and repair. 

YeuBuild-andKeep-a 16-bil 
Sanyo personal computer 

The vital core of your training is the 
step-by-step building of the 16-bit Sanyo 
MBC-550 series computer. Once you've 
mastered the details of this state-of-the- 
art machine, you'll be qualified to 
service and repair virtually every major 
brand of computer, plus many popular 
peripheral and accessory devices. 

With NRi training, you learn at your 
own convenience, in your own home. 
You set the pace— without classroom 
pressures, rigid night-school schedules, 
or wasted time. You build the Sanyo 
IBM compatible computer from the 
keyboard up, with your own personal 
NRI instructor and the complete NRI 
technical staff ready to answer your 
questions or give you guidance and 
special help whenever you need it. 

Praised by critics as the "most 
infriguing" of all the IBM-PC compatible 
computers, the new Sanyo uses the same 
8088 microprocessor as the IBM-PC and

features the MS/DOS operating system. 
As a result, you'll have a choice of 
thousands of off-the-shelf software pro- 
grams to run on your completed Sanyo. 

Your NRI course includes 
installation and troubleshooting of the 
"intelligent" keyboard, power supply, 
and disk drive, plus you'll check out 



the 8088 microprocessor functions, using 
machine language. You'll also prepare 
the interfaces for future 
peripherals such as printers 
and joysticks.

36 COMPUTEI April 1 986 




This strikinglif beautiful picture was created on the Amiga's 320 X 200-pixel screen 
in 52 colors with Aegis Images, a graphics-art program demonstrated at CES. 



gis Animator, for creating animated 
sequences; and Impact, an executive 
graphics package. Images, Animator, 
and Impact were actually devel- 
oped by Island Graphics of Sausa- 
lito, California. Under an 
agreement with Commodore, they 
were supposed to be released under 
the Amiga brand name. For in- 
stance. Images was originally 
known as Graphicraft or ProPaint 
(several screens created with this 
program appear on the Amiga's 
packaging and in the September 
1985 issue of COMPUTE!). But Island 
Graphics and Commodore had a 
falling out, and the Amiga Graphi- 
craft currently being sold is not the 
software developed by Island 



Graphics. Instead, Aegis acquired 
the marketing rights to the Island 
Graphics programs, enhanced 
them, and renamed them Aegis Im- 
ages, Animator, and Impact. 

Images is available for $79.95 
separately, or for $139.95 in a pack- 
age with Aegis Animator. Using lin- 
ages screens as a backdrop. 
Animator allows 3-D animation and 
rotation, metamorphic shape ma- 
nipulation, storyboarding of up to 
nine separate sequences, and 
ghost-line animation. Impact 
($199.95) is for business presenta- 
tion graphics and includes a slide 
show feature — charts, graphs, and 
pictures can be flipped in a prede- 
termined sequence and transformed. 




Impact, another product from Aegis 
Development, makes it possible to pro- 
duce three-dimensional business graph- 
ics using the Amiga's 4,096 colors. 



Aegis Draw is a Computer-Aided 
Design (CAD) program for the Amiga 
which is aimed at professional users.

Supra Corporation (Albany, 
Oregon) announced a series 
of hard disk drives for the 
Atari ST with capacities of 10, 20, 
40, and 80 megabytes. Prices start 
at $799 for 10 megabytes. They 
should be available this spring. 

Optimized Systems Software 
(San Jose, California) was demon- 
strating Personal Pascal for the ST at 
the Atari booth and has already 
started shipping. This language 
•supports all of the ST's special fea- 
tures, compiles and links most pro- 
grams in about a minute (even

disk), and sells for $74.95. OSS is 
also readying a version of the Pro- 
log language and a set of disk utili- 
ties for the ST. 

Cardco (Wichita, Kansas), 
known in the past for its VIC-20 
and Commodore 64 add-ons, is 
preparing a one-megabyte memory

ery Kit for the Amiga, GameMaker 
lets you write videogames without 
learning a programming language. 
Finished games can be saved on a 
blank disk and run independently 
of the master program, so you can 
distribute copies to friends. Activi- 
sion is sponsoring a GameMaker 
contest — first prize is a trip to Ac- 
tivision plus $5,000. 

The Music Studio is a composi- 
tion tool designed by Audio Light

Brataccas ($49.95) is a graphics ad- 
venture game for both computers 
that was developed by Psygnosis 
Limited of England, It was written 
specifically to take advantage of the 
68000 chip inside the Amiga and 
ST, In Brataccas, you're a scientist 
who has invented a genetic process 
for creating a superbeing. With an 
evil government and the under- 
world in pursuit, you flee to a colo- 
nized asteroid, Brataccas. The 
object is to expose the govern- 
ment's corruption and clear your 
name. Brataccus is populated with 
nearly 60 different characters. 

For the Amiga only. Mind- 
scape is releasing The Halley Pro- 
ject: A Mission in Our Solar System 
($49.95), a realtime simulation of 
the solar system developed by Tom 
Snyder Productions with help from 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology; Deja Vu: A Nightmare 
Come True ($54.95), a 1940s-style 
mystery game; and Keyboard Cadet 
($39.95), a typing tutor. (Incidental- 
ly, Mindscape is the company 
which wrote the Amiga Tutor sup- 
plied with the Amiga.) 

Abacus Software (Grand Rap- 
ids, Michigan) is importing a pro- 
fessional-quality program called PC 
Board Design for the ST. When Aba- 
cus finishes translating this circuit- 
designing utility from German, it 
will sell for $395. 

Batteries Included (Richmond 
Hill, Ontario) was demonstrating 
its D.E.G.A.S. drawing program for 
the ST with a slideshow of screens 
called up in rapid sequence from a 
hard disk, D.E.G.A.S. started ship- 
ping just before CES, and it's al- 
ready a hit — Batteries Included 
says that sales figures for the first 
two weeks were greater than for 
any other program in its history. ST 
and Amiga versions of the Isgur 
Portfolio System, a stock-manage- 
ment program, are scheduled for 
release later this year at $249.95. 

Q-R-S (Buffalo, New York), a 
company that started back in 1900 
by making music rolls for player 
pianos, is releasing its digital music 
library for the Amiga and ST. This

Quest 11, and Ylalt Disney's The 
Black Cauldron. The King's Quest 
games have been particularly pop- 
ular on IBM computers. 

Spinnaicer Software (Boston, 
Massachusetts) has converted Fahr- 
enheit 451, Treasure Island, Perry 
Mason, Nine Princes of Amber, Ama- 
zon, and Homework Helper Math for 
the ST. 



The popular eight-bit com- 
puters weren't ignored by 
software publishers, either, 
and some significant new programs 
were announced for the Commo- 
dore 64, 128, Apple, IBM PC/PCjr, 
and Atari. There isn't room here to 
list them all, but additional infor- 
mation can be found in this month's 
"News & Products" section. 

One of the biggest hits at the 
show was a graphics-oriented oper- 
ating system in final stages of de- 
velopment for the Commodore 64. 
Called GEOS (Graphic Environ- 
ment Operating System), it's mod- 
eled after the user interface 
popularized by the Macintosh and 
adapted by the Atari ST and Amiga. 
GEOS loads from disk and replaces 
the 64's normal operating system. It 
speeds up disk access by a factor of 
five to seven times and displays a 
desktop screen with pull-down 
menus, icons, and windows. You 
manipulate these features by mov- 
ing an on-screen pointer with a 
mouse or joystick. 

Although some people were 
skeptical that GEOS could run fast 
enough on an eight-bit machine, 
even the unfinished version at CES 
ran surprisingly smoothly. By mov- 
ing the pointer to a menu bar at the 
top of the screen and pressing the 
joystick button, you can select vari- 
ous options for managing files and 
running applications (see photo). 
To rename a file, for instance, you 
pull down the File menu and 
choose Rename. The new filename 
you enter appears on the directory 
or beneath the program's icon. To 
delete a file, you point to its icon, 
press the joystick button, and 
"drag" the icon to the trash can 
icon. To print a file, you drag its 
icon to the printer icon. 

The screen would get cluttered

The desktop screen from GEOS, a remarkable Macintosh-like operatitig system for 
the Commodore 64. It offers pull-down menus, icons, windows, desk accessories, and 
custom type fonts, and also speeds up disk access five to seven times. 



if the icons for every file were dis- 
played at once, so GEOS lets you 
flip through windows as if they 
were pages in a book. The page 
number of the current window is 
displayed near its bottom margin. 
As the accompanying photo shows, 
GEOS uses the Commodore 64's 
high-resolution graphics screen to 
display a smaller-sized character set. 

The desktop includes a full 
range of Macintosh-like desk acces- 
sories, such as a calculator, note- 
pad, alarm clock, photo and text 
albums (for transferring data be- 
tween applications), and a prefer- 
ences window. The preferences 
window lets you adjust screen col- 
ors, change the shape and speed of 
the pointer, set the date and time, 
and so forth. The desk accessories 
can be called up while running oth- 
er applications — if you're using the 
word processor and need to per- 
form a calculation, for example, you 
can pop open the calculator, gel 
your answer, close the calculator, 
and continue writing. 

GEOS comes with two applica- 
tions: geoWrite, a what-you-see-is- 
what-you-get word processor that 
lets you type on-screen with several 
different proportional fonts, and 
geoPaint, a graphics-drawing pro- 
gram with vertical and horizontal 
scrolling that lets you create images 



as large as an 8V2 X 11 -inch page 
(80 dots per inch resolution). 

The price for the entire pack- 
age — GEOS, the desktop and desk 
accessories, geoWrite and geo- 
Paint — is $59.95. It was designed 
by Berkeley Softworks (Berkeley, 
California) and is scheduled to be 
available early this spring. 

Timeworks (Deerfield, Illinois) 
is releasing three new pro- 
grams for the Commodore 
128 and one for the 64. Partner 128 
($59.95) and Partner 64 ($49.95) are 
desktop management programs 
similar to Borland International's 
Sidekick for the IBM PC. Both Part- 
ner programs include a multifunc- 
tion business calculator, memo pad, 
appointment calendar, typewriter, 
address book, phone book, enve- 
lope addresser, and screen printer. 
SwiftCalc 128 is a. spreadsheet 
that takes advantage of the 128's 
80-column mode. It has program- 
mable keys, multilevel sorting, and 
several ways of charting data (in- 
cluding 3-D) that can be shown on 
the screen or printed out. Those 
who already own the original Swift- 
Calc for the Commodore 64 can 
upgrade to the 128 version for a 
nominal fee. Timeworks has also 
adapted Sylvia Porter's Personal 



Financial Planner ($69,95)' for the 
128's 80 -column mode. 

Cardco (Wichita, Kansas) an- 
nounced a Sidekick-style product, 
too. Called Side Saddle (Cardco is 
negotiating with Borland for the 
Sidekick name), it offers quick ac- 
cess to a calculator, appointment 
calendar, telephone directory/ dial- 
er, memo pad, screen printer, and 
disk functions. It comes on a car- 
tridge for the Commodore 64, with 
a 128 version to follow. Another 
interesting Cardco program is 
Freeze Frame, a screen printer that 
Cardco claims can capture any 64 
screen on paper, even with com- 
mercial software. It works with any 
printer that emulates the Commo- 
dore 1525, and all Epson- and 
Okidata-compatibles. A 128 ver- 
sion of Freeze Frame is also planned. 

The Commodore 128 got an- 
other boost when Cardco an- 
nounced its Personal Productivity 
Series for the 128's CP/M mode. 
The first three products in the series 
are Personal Accoutitanl, a financial 
manager for home or small busi- 
ness; Personal Inventory, for figuring 
your net worth; and Personal Time 
Manager, which can handle up to 26 
events for as many as 240 people. 
Each program sells for $39.95. 

In addition to software, Cardco 
announced three hard disk drives 
for the 64 and 128. Available in late 
March for the 64 and shortly after- 
ward for the 128, the drives will 
come in 5-, 10-, and 20-megabyte 
capacities for $599.95, $899.95, and 
$1,299.95, respectively. They're ca- 
pable of loading a full-function 
spreadsheet program in IVi 
seconds. 

Access Software (Salt Lake 
City, Utah) is releasing a number of 
products for the Commodore 64, 
128, Atari, and Apple. The Much 
128 Enhancement Package is a car- 
tridge and disk for the 64 and 128. 
When the cartridge is plugged in, it 
senses whether a 1541 or 1571 disk 
drive is connected and — in the case 
of the 128 — which mode is active. 
Then it engages or disengages disk 
speed-up routines as appropriate. 
Typically there's a fivefold increase 
in loading speed with either the 
1541 or 1571. The cartridge also has 
a system reset switch. In addition, 
the Mach 128 disk includes a disk 
organizer utility, two machine lan- 
guage monitors, and a program that 



expands BASIC workspace by 4K. 
The price is $49.95. 

The Development System 
($79.95) is a professional macro as- 
sembler and text editor for the Com- 
modore 128 (128 or 64 mode) and 
64. It includes Spritemaster, a utility 
for creating and animating sprites 
with machine language programs. 

leader Board, The Pro Golf Sim- 
ulator is a 3-D game that offers a 
perspective view of the golf course. 
It's one of the most detailed sports 
simulations we've ever seen, with 
multiple 18-hole courses, handi- 
capping, a wide range of clubs, and 
numerous other variables. The Com- 
modore 64 version should be avail- 
able immediately for $39.95. Inside 
Story — The Anatomy Learning Sys- 
tem is an educational program udth 
50 high-resolution graphics screens 
that let you explore the inner work- 
ing of the human body. For the Com- 
modore 64, the price is $34.95. 

For the Atari 400/800, XL, XE, 
and Apple II series. Access Soft- 
ware is releasing Raid Over Moscow 
and Beach-Head U: The Dictator 
Strikes Back, popular games previ- 
ously available for the Commodore 
64 and 128. In Raid Over Moscow, 
the Soviets have launched a nuclear 
attack on North America; your job 
is to deploy stealth bombers from 
an orbiting space station to destroy 
the warheads before they hit. It re- 
quires at least 48K RAM and sells 
for $34.95. Beach-Head 11 is the se- 
quel to Beach-Head and features 
speech synthesis, multiple screens, 
and the choice of playing another 
person or the computer. It requires at 
least 48K RAM and sells for $39.95. 

Access has signed an agree- 
ment with Multibotics, Inc. (Woods 
Cross, Utah) to market its line of 
robotic construction sets. The 
sets — for youngsters and adults — 
contain snap-together connectors, 
gears, shafts, clutches, wheels, elec- 
tric motors, and other parts that 
make it possible to build all sorts of 
motorized contraptions that can be 
controlled by a personal computer. 
You can also experiment with digi- 
tized speech or temporarily turn a 
computer into a voltmeter or oscillo- 
scope. Four different Multibot sets 
are avaOable from $59.95 to $199.95. 
Interfaces are ready for the Commo- 
dore 64 and 128, and Access is work- 
ing on interfaces for Atari, Apple, 
Amiga, and IBM computers. 



If you've got a good memory, you 
might recall reading some re- 
views about a year ago of a Com- 
modore 64 word processor called 
SkiWriter. Although the reviews 
were good, marketing problems 
kept the program from appearing 
on store shelves. Now it's been ac- 
quired by a British company, Mas- 
tertronic (U.S. offices in Frederick, 
Maryland). Two changes were 
made — the built-in telecommuni- 
cations feature was dropped, and 
the program is being sold on disk 
instead of cartridge — but the price 
has been chopped from $69.95 to 
$15. There's also a Commodore 128 
and Apple II version. At the same 
time, Mastertronics is introducing 
two more programs for the Com- 
modore 64: Busicalc 3, a spread- 
sheet, and Instant Recall, a filer that 
stores up to 30,000 characters of 
data. Both of these products sell for 
$15, too. 

Mindscape (Northbrook, Illi- 
nois) is bringing out The Luscher 
Profile (Apple, Commodore 64, 
IBM PC, and Mac), which con- 
structs a psychological profile 
based on a person's reactions to 
colors and shapes; The American 
Challenge: A Sailing Simulation (Ap- 
ple and IBM), an unusual America's 
Cup simulation that can be played 
by two people in remote locations 
using computers and modems; Dick 
Francis' High Stakes (Apple and 
IBM), an interactive text adventure 
that puts you in the role of a 
wealthy English horse owner; a 
talking Macintosh version of Racier, 
the AI (artificial insanity) program 
that holds bizarre conversations 
with humans; and Stephen King's 
The Mist and James Bond: A View To 
A Kill (Apple, IBM, and Mac), text 
adventures based on popular thrill- 
ers. All of these programs are 
$39,95, except for Racier, which is 
$44,95, 

And finally, if you can spare 
$39.95, you can now indulge any 
Rambo fantasies you might have 
with a Mindscape program called 
Rambo: First Blood Part 11. But Rambo 
isn't the shoot-em-up action game 
you might expect — it's a text ad- 
venture. One of its features is a 
sophisticated parser that lets you 
communicate in plain English 
(which is more than the movie 
character Rambo can do). It runs on 
the Apple, IBM, and Macintosh. ©

Tug-A-War 

Mark Tuttle, Submissions Reviewer 



Don't be fooled by the apparent sim- 
plicity of this two-player strategy 
game. It looks easy on the surface, but 
it's a stiff test of your concentration 
and ability to think ahead. The origi- 
nal version was written for the Com- 
modore 64. We've added new versions 
for the Atari 400/800, XL, and XE, 
Apple Il-series computers. Atari 
520ST, Amiga, IBM PC/PCjr, and the 
TI-99/4A. Since the game is based on 
colors, every version requires a color 
monitor or TV. The IBM version re- 
quires BASICA and a color /graphics 
adapter for the PC or Cartridge 
BASIC for the PCjr. The Atari version 
requires at least 16K of RAM, and the 
Amiga version requires at least 512K. 



Nearly everyone has played tug of 
war at one time or another. The 
traditional game pits two players or 
teams at opposite ends of a rope. At 
the middle of the rope is a flag, and 
each side tries to pull the flag into 
its territory. "Tug-a-War" is based 
on a similar concept. In this version, 
the flag is replaced with a round 
ball shape, and each player tries to 
maneuver the ball onto his or her 
side of the screen. Like many two- 
player games, the difficulty of Tug- 
a-War depends somewhat on the 
intelligence of your opponent. But 
even at the simplest level, you'll 
find that skill and foresight are es- 
sential to success. 

Type in and save the appropri- 
ate program below. The rules are the 
same for every version (except Atari 
520ST — see special instructions). 

Battle Of The Colors 

When you run Tug-a-War, two sets 
of colored boxes appear, one above 
the other. The lower, longer series 
of squares is the playing field. Near 
the middle of the pi ay field area is a 

42 COMPUTB April 1986 



round ball; the outermost boxes at 
each end of the playfield represent 
each player's home position. The 
players alternate turns, each trying 
to move the ball in their own direc- 
tion, until it reaches one of the 
home squares. 

So far, so good — but how do 
you move the ball? It's done not by 
pulling a rope, but by changing the 
colors of boxes in the playfield. The 
color of the square under the ball 
determines which direction it 
moves and how far it travels. On 
any given turn, the ball can move 
either one or two squares to the left, 
or one or two squares to the right. 
At the top of the screen are four 
boxes that show you which colors 
are linked to which directions. For 
instance, the leftmost box shows 
you which color makes the ball 
move one square to the left. The 
next box to the right shows you 
which color makes it move two 
squares to the left. The second pair 
of boxes show you which colors 
make the ball move in the opposite 
direction, to the right. By changing 
the color of the box where the ball 
is currently located, you can make it 
move toward your home square. 

The playfield contains 11 box- 
es (9 in the TI version, 10 in the 
Atari ST version). When the game 
begins, each of these boxes is ran- 
domly given one of the four colors 
shown at the top of the screen. On 
each turn, you may change the 
color of one, several, or all of the 
boxes (however, you must always 
change at least one box). Below 
each box is a number which repre- 
sents its distance from the home 
position of the player whose turn it 
is. For instance, if you are the player 
on the left, then on your turn the 
boxes are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., 
from left to right (the tenth box is 
marked with a 0, and the eleventh 



with an A). When it's the right play- 
er's turn, the numbering is reversed 
(the rightmost box is 1, etc.). 

To take a turn, you must select 
a number that corresponds to the 
numbers shown below the boxes in 
the playfield. This is done by press- 
ing a single key. Press a number 
key from 1-0 to select one of the 
first ten values, or press the A key 
to choose the eleventh box. The 
number you choose determines 
how many boxes change color. For 
instance, if you press 1, only one 
box (the one nearest your home 
square) changes color. If you press 
2, the two boxes nearest your home 
box change, and so on. 

Where do the new colors come 
from? Every box cycles through the 
same series of four colors shown in 
the uppermost set of boxes, going 
from left to right. For example, if 
the colors shown there are white- 
blue-red-purple (the exact colors 
may be different on your com- 
puter), then a white square always 
changes to blue; a blue square al- 
ways changes to red; a purple 
square changes to white, and so on. 
In other words, the box's current 
color determines which color it gets 
after the next color change. 

Though every turn involves at 
least one color change, the ball 
doesn't necessarily move on every 
turn. It only moves when you 
change all the boxes between your 
home position and the current posi- 
tion of the ball. For example, if the 
ball is three boxes away from your 
home square, then you must 
change the color of at least three 
boxes in order to move it at all. 

Foresight Rewarded 

As you can see, there's much more 
to this game than appears on the 
surface. At first you might be 
tempted to try to move the ball as

often as possible. But that's usually 
a losing strategy. Remember, the 
direction the ball moves depends on 
the color of its square before you 
take the turn. 

In many cases, you'll want to 
move the ball only if it's on a color 
that moves it toward your goal. But 
like other games of strategy, Tug-a- 
War rewards the player who looks 
beyond the current move and tries 
to set things up for future moves; 
sometimes it's wise to make a 
small, temporary sacrifice in order 
to benefit later in the game. Because 
the boxes change colors in the same 
sequence, the effect of your own 
move is always completely predict- 
able. However, since a single turn 
can change the color of many box- 
es, dramatic changes of fortune are 
also possible. 

Amiga And 520ST Versions 

Since the mouse is an integral sys- 
tem feature on both the Amiga and 
ST, both of these versions substi- 
tute mouse input for keyboard in- 
put. To select a square, simply 
move the mouse pointer to the de- 
sired box and press the left mouse 
button. Because keyboard prompts 
are unnecessary, no numbers are 
displayed below the playfield 
boxes. 

Before entering BASIC to load 
the ST version, you should switch 
to the low-resolution graphics 
mode (use the Set Preferences op- 
tion in the desktop's Options 
menu). Also, if your ST has 512K 
and a disk-based operating system, 
before running the program you 
should turn off buffered graphics 
(controlled by the Buffer Grph op- 
tion in the Settings menu; it's off 
when no check appears beside the 
option in the menu). The standard 
520ST leaves only about 5K free for 
BASIC programs, so Tug-a-War 
won't fit into memory unless the 
buffered graphics option is turned 
off. The program fits with buffered 
graphics switched on only if you 
have a 1040ST, or a 520ST with 
memory expansion, or a 520ST that 
has been upgraded with the TOS 
operating system in ROM chips 
(Read Only Memory). 

The Amiga version uses the 
computer's built-in speech feature 
to announce the players' turns. In 
other respects, these games work 
exactly like the others,

Silent Service 



Neil Randall 

Requirements: Commodore 64 or 128 (in 
64 mode); Apple Il-sertes computer with 
at least 64K RAM; Atari 400/800, XL, or 
XE with at least 48K RAM; IBM PC with 
color/graphics adaptei; or an IBM PCjr. A 
disk drive is also required, and a joystick 
is recommended. The Commodore version 
was reviewed. 



Silent Service, from Microprose Soft- 
ware, is one of a new type of computer 
war game. A cross between arcade ac- 
tion games and traditional strategy war 
games, these new games put you on the 
battlefield in command of a plane, tank, 
or submarine. Microprose's F-15 Strike 
Eagle placed you in a modem jet fighter. 
In Silent Service, you're the captain of a 
U.S. submarine in the Pacific during 
World War II. Your mission is to sink 
Japanese cargo, troop, and oil shipping. 
The game includes several scenarios 
based on actual engagements. 

Silent Service employs several 
graphics screens to relay the infor- 
mation needed to command the sub. 
The Patrol Navigation Map shows a 
150,000 square-mile area of the Pacific 
Ocean from Midway Island to China 
(east to west), and Australia to the 
U.S.S.R. (south to north). This is the 
strategic map on which j'ou move your 
sub to find Japanese shipping lanes. 
Once you've found a convoy, the tacti- 
cal map kicks in. 

The tactical map is actually a series 
of three differently scaled maps. The 
Patrol Area Map is described above. 
You can zoom to the Navigation Map, 
which shows an area of 2,400 square 
miles around your sub, and zooming 
further yields the Attack Plot, a 40- 
square-mile area. The detail of land 
masses and enemy ships changes with 
the zoom. The Attack Plot displays the 
wake of each ship, to show which direc- 
tion it is going. You use the Patrol Area 
Map to find the enemy convoy, the 
Navigation Map to close in on it, and 
the Attack Plot to position your sub for 
attack. 



Superb Graphics 

Once you've located your prey, you 
shift to a view of the conning tower, the 
captain's station. Using the joystick (the 
game is joystick- or keyboard- 
controlled), you either use the peri- 



scope or move the captain to one of the 
other stations: instruments and gauges, 
maps and charts, damage reports, quar- 
termaster's log, or the bridge. Like the 
map screens, each battle station screen 
is graphically superb and very detailed.

April 1986 COMPUTE) 61 



If the sub is surfaced, you can 
climb to the bridge. From here you can 
look around to spot the enemy ships, 
using your naked eyes or binoculars. 
The view includes the Japanese ships 
(several varieties, each graphically dif- 
ferent) and the land on the horizon. The 
landforms correspond exactly to where 
you are in the Pacific; if you patrol to 
the coast of New Guinea, you will see 
the coast of New Guinea. Given the 
amount of territory covered in the 
game, the mapping system is obviously 
very sophisticated. 

The binoculars and periscope 
screens include all the details necessary 
for firing at the ships: target type, target 
range and speed, and such data as angle- 
on-bow. You may fire the deck guns or 
torpedoes, but only torpedoes are con- 
sistently effective. 

These screens are the heart of the 
action, but to keep the sub running you 
must pay strict attention to your ves- 
sel's instruments and gauges. They dis- 
play information about the battery, the 
depth of the sub and of the ocean floor 
beneath you, fuel levels, the status of 
hull openings, and so on. For instance, 
the battery allows restricted underwater 
maneuvering, depending on your 
speed, and then must be recharged on 
the surface. 




This assortment of screens from Silent Service 
shows the diversity of the program's graphics. 

Attention To Detail 

Other facets of the game are equally 
realistic. If your sub hits the ocean bot- 
tom, you hear a scraping sound and the 
hull may be damaged. You can cruise at 
four speeds or cut the engines for silent 
running. More esoterically, once per 
mission you can get rid of your emer- 
gency tanks to stop a fatal dive, or 
release debris to the surface to fool the 
Japanese destroyers into thinking 
you've been sunk. Sound effects range 
from sonar pings — telling you that de- 
stroyers are closing in — to the ominous 
explosions of nearby depth charges. 
The sub's hull even creaks if you dive 
deeper than it was tested for, and you 
hear a grinding metallic sound if you're 



rammed by an enemy ship. Silent Ser- 
vice's detail is astonishing. 

But the most impressive part of the 
detail is that it does not impede play. 
Detail in the more traditional type of 
war game frequently hinders under- 
standing and lengthens the game con- 
siderably, but Silent Service plays quite 
easily after only a half-hour or so of 
practice. Once you learn how to steer 
the sub and fire torpedoes at a target, 
you can try a mission. You can learn the 
rest, such as diving and running silent 
at the approach of a Japanese destroyer, 
as the situation demands. At any time, 
you can pause the game to allow you 
time to think. 

Like F-I5 Strike Eagle, Silent Service 
is both intriguing and addicting. Also 
like F-15, it is highly educational, but 
there is nothing tedious about the les- 
sons. The excellent manual describes 
the submarine war in the Pacific, the 
background to the scenarios, and the 
tactics used by sub captains. By playing 
the game, you'll quickly find that these 
captains knew what they were doing. 
Silent Service is a superior product.

DeluxePainf For Amiga 



Lee Noel, Assistant Editor, Art & Design 



Requirements: Amiga with at least 256K 
RAM (512K recommended). Printer 
optional. 

Whenever a new computer appears on 
the market, some of the most important 
factors affecting its success are the qual- 
ity and diversity of its software. In the 
case of the long-awaited and innovative 
Amiga, questions concerning software 
support become even more important. 
Is this computer the powerhouse it's 
said to be, and can programs be written 
to take full advantage of its capabilities? 

Electronic Arts, a software publish- 
er widely considered to be at the fore- 
front of personal computing, said yes to 
both questions and threw its consider- 
able weight squarely behind the Amiga. 
DeluxePaint, by Dan Silva, is one of the 
first results. Not surprisingly — consid- 
ering the Amiga's selling point as a 
computer for those who want a "cre- 
ative edge" — DeluxePaint is a visual 
arts program of immense scope and 
flexibility. 

In fact, DeluxePaint is really three 
different programs of immense scope 



and flexibility. Due to differing memory 
requirements, DeluxePaint includes a 
separate program for each of the Ami- 
ga's three major screen modes: 320 pix- 
els across by 200 down with 32 
simultaneous colors; 640 X 200 with 16 
colors; and 640 X 400 with 16 colors. 
The number of simultaneous colors in 
each mode can be selected from a pal- 
ette of 4,096 possible colors. You can 
also customize DeluxePaint by restrict- 
ing it to a smaller palette. 

After booting up the program disk, 
you must type in a command to call up 
whatever incarnation of DeluxePaint 
you want. This may sound confusing to 
nontechnical artists hoping to use the 
Amiga for their first experiments in 
computer graphics, but loading the pro- 
gram is fairly straightforward. First you 
turn on the Amiga and insert the usual 
Kickstart disk. When the prompt asking 
for the Workbench disk appears, you 
insert the DeluxePaint disk instead. 
AmigaDOS comes up next with its 1> 
prompt, and then you type the appro- 
priate command. For instance, you'd 
enter dpaint and press RETURN to 
work in the 320 X 200 mode. 



Best For 320 X 200 

DeluxePaint works best by far in the 320 
X 200 mode. In the 640 X 200 mode, 
pixels are three times as high as they are 
wide, and the program slows down 
considerably, In 640 X 400, the slow- 
down is drastic. So much memory is 
consumed that there's not enough 
room in a 512K machine for both the 
entire program and a screen. Instead, 
the program is broken into modules 
that are constantly swapped in and out 
from disk. (DeluxePaint works this way 
in all modes on a 256K Amiga.) 

Also, the 640 X 400 mode suffers 
from a jittering screen display. The jit- 
tering varies depending on the color 
combinations, and high-contrast com- 
binations are worse. This isn't Deluxe- 
Paint's fault — the monitor simply 
cannot refresh the 256,000 pixels in this 
mode fast enough to display a stable 
picture. (Other computers with similar 
modes get around this problem by 
using special monochrome monitors 
driven at higher refresh rates.) 

Since DeluxePaint's features are the 
same in all modes, we'll describe what's 
available in the 320 X 200 mode. This 
is the most color-rich screen, and the 
program's documentation and all of the 
sample pictures on the disk are slanted 
toward it.

kyan's latest programming tool adds a new dimension 
to assembly language programming. The Assem- 
bler/Linker includes a text editor, 65C02 macro assem- 
bler, object module linker, debugger, and librarian. 



Tons Of Tools 

Like virtually all Amiga software, De- 
luxePaint is a mouse-driven, icon-based 
program, similar in some ways to Mac- 
Paint for the Macintosh. An array of 
drawing tools is represented by icons 
on the computer's display (the tools can 
be hidden when the picture is finished). 
Tools are selected by moving a pointer 
to the appropriate icon with the mouse. 
A click of the mouse button activates 
the tool, which can then be used in the 
drawing area. 

DeluxePaiut has practically all of 
the tools that have become standard in 
graphics-design programs. You can 
draw straight lines and a multiplicity of 
outlined or filled shapes, paint with 
different-sized brushes or an "air- 
brush," print text on the screen, and 
lots more. But DeluxePaint really shines 
because it offers unique new tools and 
novel extensions to the old standbys. 

First and foremost, DeluxePaint 
recognizes the importance of color to 
the artist. The program has a special 
palette window where any of the Ami- 
ga's thousands of colors can be mixed 
and used in design work. The palette 
appears from the program's title bar as 
a pull-down menu (the menu selections 
have alternate keyboard commands as 
well.) 




This picture of a paint can and brush — 
included on the DeluxePaint disk — 
shows the fine shading possible with 32 
simultaneous colors chosen from a pal- 
ette of 4,096. 



Within the palette is an almost be- 
wildering number of options. For in- 
stance, there are two ways to make 
color adjustments. The first method has 
three slide controls — manipulated with 
the mouse — that alter the percentages 
of red, green, and blue in any color 
(these are the primary colors for a video 
display). Another set of three sliders 
allows changes to the hue, saturation, 
and value of any selected color. The 
latter system is much like the tint, color, 
and contrast controls on a normal color 
TV. As a result, novice users of Deluxe- 



Paint may find this system reassuringly 
familiar. 

If that's not enough flexibility, the 
artist can also move the palette window 
to any convenient location, and the re- 
location will be "remembered" for the 
rest of the current session. 

Flowing Colors 

Colors are selected simply by pointing 
and clicking with the mouse; selection 
is verified by a highlighted box. Color 
changes are instantly reflected in the 
palette window and in the picture. As a 
consequence, it's delightfully easy to 
adjust colors relative to each other. The 
program disk includes two good exam- 
ples of the effects made possible by this 
precise control over a diverse palette. 
"KingTut" displays the hard, gleaming 
gold coffin mask of the Egyptian boy- 
king Tutankhamen. In contrast, "Ve- 
nus" faithfully reproduces the soft, 
almost pearly hues of Botticelli's "Birth 
of Venus." 

Some really amazing special ef- 
fects are also built into DeluxePaint'^ 
palette, such as animated color cycling. 
This allows the artist to establish three 
sets of colors that will cycle through a 
certain range. Each range can be narrow 
or wide, can include harmonious or 
clashing colors, and can overlap the

ranges for the other two cycles. Once 
activated, a cycle runs through all the 
colors in its range in a smooth se- 
quence. The speed of each cycle can be 
individually controlled with the mouse 
and a slider. Color cycling Is what 
makes the disk's sample waterfall pic- 
ture seem to flow. With thought and 
care, you can create effects otherwise 
impossible in two-dimensional art. 

Closer to traditional art media are 
tools which smear, shade, and blend. 
Smearing enables an artist to use the 
DeluxePaint brush to smudge colors al- 
ready painted on the display. The effect 
is similar to running a brush through 
fresh oil paints. Shading and blending 
work on a defined color range, like the 
ranges for color cycling. Both operate 
best on a range of closely related shades 
and affect only the colors in the selected 
range. 

The action of shading is difficult to 
explain in print, but blending does pret- 
ty much what it describes — it produces 
smooth gradations like those found in 
watercolor washes or airbrushing. 
There are also tools for exchanging col- 
ors and an undo feature to recover from 
mistakes. 

Anything Is A Brush 

All that's fine for the colors, but what of 
the brushes that apply them? Once 
again, DeluxePaint offers abundant op- 
tions. There are, of course, some built- 
in brushes. These are various useful 
shapes, and they can all be adjusted in 
size with one of the program's easy-to- 
use tools. But, as might be expected, 
other brush manipulations range into 
some wild and unexplored regions. 

The essence of DeluxePaint 
brushes is this: Anything can be a 
brush, so you can paint with a single 
pixel, a pictorial element, a whole 
screen, or anything in-between. And if 
that's not enough, the artist can grab 
the brush, resize it, rotate it to any 
angle, flip it, or drag it into a completely 
new shape. This last feature allows a 
brush that looks flat to be made to 
appear three-dimensional. To get an 
idea of the effect, imagine a flag lying 
flat on a table. Suddenly, it's bent into a 
stiff billow and paints in an arc across 
the sky — stars and stripes and colors 
and all. 

Brushes, like complete pictures, 
can be saved to previously prepared 
data disks. There are also some esoteric 
possibilities involving the exchange of 
transparent and solid colors within a 
brush, plus a different way to "hold" 
the current brush, and a way to speed 
up response time to certain types of 
brushes. Analogies are hard to come by 
for these features, but they open up 
fascinating possibilities not available to

Paint disk is this reproduction of Botti- 
celli's "Birth of Venus."

dow, just one of the many features in

artists working in traditional media. 

The basis for all the brush transfor- 
mations is the designer's ability to reach 
out and capture any area of the screen 
with a special brush selection tool. This 
is much like the copy, cut, and paste 
functions found in other graphics pro- 
grams, and it can be used for those 
purposes as well as brush design. 

Room To Zoom 

A full description of DeluxePaint's myr- 
iad features would run on for many 
pages (the manual is 31 pages long), but 
highlights of some of the major ones 
not covered so far bear mentioning. 

DeluxePaint has a special magnifi- 
cation tool that allows the artist to 
zoom closer and closer to the area un- 
der inspection, and then back away in 
similar increments. Great mobility 
within the magnify mode is provided 
with the cursor keys. 

There's fairly complete printer 
support, plus the ability to add text to 
designs and manipulate it in numerous 
ways. A skewing feature even lets you 
turn ordinary text into italics. 

For precision design work, one op- 
tion gives a constantly updated display 
of the cursor's screen coordinates, an- 
other provides a grid that can be modi- 
fied, and still another allows unusual 
mirror-like symmetry effects. 



Virtually anything that anyone 
ever wanted in a personal computer 
graphics program is included in Deluxe- 
Paint — and it's all easy to use and easy 
to learn. It's fortunate that the program 
is fairly intuitive because the documen- 
tation is not. The basic tone of the 
manual is that experimentation and 
playfulness are the best methods for 
coming to grips with the program. A 
step-by-step approach might have been 
more helpful. And, ironically, the man- 
ual's graphics are almost nonexistent. 

Another problem with the manual 
is that it lacks completeness. Deluxe- 
Paint cannot create data disks by itself, 
so the artist must refer to Chapter 4 of 
the Amiga User's Guide for the infor- 
mation. Also, hardly any program com- 
mands are summarized in DeluxePaint's 
command summary. 

On the other hand, in the few 
places where you might get really 
stuck, the documentation comes 
through with some solid tutorials. 

Bottom line: Will DeluxePaint and 
an Amiga give you that creative edge? 
That depends — in the end, it's still the 
artist that has to pull the rabbit out of 
the hat.

S'More For 
Commodore 64 



Art Hunkins 

Requirements: Commodore 64 or a Com- 
modore 128 in 64 mode. 

Commodore 64 owners who wish to 
upgrade their computers have two 
main options; Buy a Commodore 128 or 
install a S'more cartridge from Cardco. 
Each choice has its advantages. If mon- 
ey is no object (and you aren't overly 
attached to your 64), you might consid- 
er the 128. But the choice isn't that 
clear-cut. For those who write their 
own BASIC programs, S'more has some 
significant advantages of its own. 
Frankly, it's difficult to know which to 
compare S'more to — the 64 without 
S'more, or the 128. 

Of course, the 128 does have some 
things going for it: twice the available 
user memory (122,365 bytes) as the 64; 
BASIC 7,0, with powerful commands 
for graphics, sprites, sound, and win- 
dowing; and a FAST mode for double- 
speed operation. So if it's raw computer 



58 COMPUTE) April 1986 



power and extra memory you want, the 
128 is hard to beat. 

On the other hand, S'more BASIC 
is more comprehensive than BASIC 7.0 
in its utilities; it defaults to disk LOAD, 
offers a greater variety of input options 
as well as more flexible screen format- 
ting, and includes varied reset options. 
The built-in utilities are a real boon: 
MERGE, AUTO, HEX, DEC, FIND, 
CHANGE, reNUMBER, DUMP, and 
OLD— all familiar to BASIC AID users. 
The LIST command can scroll up and 
down, not true of BASIC 7.0. On the 
128, only AUTO, RENUMBER, and a 
disk file APPEND are implemented. 

Compared to the unenhanced 64, 
S'more frees up 57 percent more user 
memory — 61,183 bytes instead of 
38,911 bytes. The memory is contigu- 
ous and can be used in any way you 
desire. (As we'll see, there are other 
protected locations where machine lan- 
guage routines up to 512 bytes long 
may be stored.) 

Improved Disk Commands 

S'more BASIC and BASIC 7.0 come out 
about even when it comes to disk com- 
mands (a notable weakness with the 
unexpanded 64); only the approach is 
different. Whereas 7.0 gives a wealth of 
specific commands, S'more uses only 
one — DISK, an all-purpose "wedge" 
followed by the traditional disk access 
symbols. Both BASICs also offer nu- 
merous enhancements of standard 
commands (such as a RUN that LOADs 
and RUNs a BASIC program from disk). 
Both permit the SHIFT-RUN key com- 
binadon to LOAD/RUN the first pro- 
gram on disk. 

Both BASICS offer about the same 
range of programming structures (DO- 
LOOP, WHILE-UNTIL, IF-THEN- 
ELSE). Both implement error- trapping 
and HELP, and both have programma- 
ble function keys, though 7.0 sets aside 
almost twice the buffer (246 bytes ver- 
sus 128) for key definitions. 

S'more is also handy in that its 
LOAD and SAVE commands default to 
disk (there is no DLOAD or DSAVE), 
and that it includes a disk CATALOG/ 
directory option. In fact, due to the way 
the disk default option works, you can 
display the CATALOG, cursor to the 
program you want, type LOAD (or 
RUN), and hit RETURN— without wor- 
rying about what is displayed after the 
program name. 

ML Limitations 

For BASIC programs, S'more is superb. 
But let's look at ML applications. Here 
the picture is not so clear. 

Although S'more has a MONITOR 
command, it doesn't have a built-in 
monitor; MONITOR just links you to a 



monitor if you've loaded one into mem- 
ory. S'more comes with a disk of soft- 
ware that includes a version of 
Micromon called Smon. (Other pro- 
grams on the disk illustrate applications 
of the more noteworthy S'more BASIC 
extensions.) 

Cardco's manual is thorough, 
clear, instructive, and particularly 
forthright when it describes S'more'a 
limitations with memory addressing 
and machine language. Here's the 
catch: To make so much contiguous 
BASIC memory available, Cardco had 
to change a lot of memory locations and 
reconfigure memory. Cardco did what 
it could to maintain compatibility with 
Commodore 64 BASIC (BASIC 2.0), but 
there were limits on what was possible. 

It's remarkable that low memory 
with S'more is so highly compatible 
with BASIC 2.0. Only two differences 
will be noticed by the average program- 
mer. First, and most importantly, the 
cassette buffer has been moved. ML 
programs designed to reside there will 
have to be transported to the new loca- 
tion. Also, some of the previously free 
bytes (which you may have used for 
flags or temporary data storage) are free 
no longer (zero page 251-254 remain 
available, however). There is a bonus, 
though— a 512-byte RS-232 ii^put/- 
output buffer, protected from BASIC, 
which can be utilized for ML routines in 
most cases. 

The most critical low memory loca- 
tions for the BASIC programmer, the 
keyboard buffer and its corresponding 
character counter, remain intact. As the 
manual clearly states, however, ML 
routines that access ROM are in for 
major rewrites. The only ROM routines 
that are safe to use are the Kemal rou- 
tines when they are accessed through 
the vectors in low memory (these vec- 
tors are unchanged in location). You 
cannot access ROM subroutines direct- 
ly. This is a problem particularly with 
the SID, VIC, and CIA chips— that is, 
when working directly with screen, 
sound, and input/output peripherals. 

The S'more Solution 

To get around these limitations, the 
manual suggests that perhaps most ML 
routines are best written in S'more 
BASIC, then compiled with the (not- 
yet-released) S'more BASIC Compiler. 
This suggestion indicates the degree of 
potential difficulty in converting most 
ML programs for use with S'more. 

But there's another alternative, too. 
S'more establishes a set of CIA, VIC, 
and SID reserved variables (DIMension- 
ed arrays). Each variable corresponds to 
a CIA, VIC, or SID chip location you 
might wish to PEEK or POKE. To POKE 
the location, just assign the variable the 



desired value; presto, the POKE is 
done. To PEEK the location, just use the 
reserved variable in an expression. It 
works fine and is simpler than actually 
PEEKing and POKEing. For sound and 
the SID chip, for example, it is not too 
far from the convenience of using 
BASIC 7.0's new sound commands 
(PLAY, FILTER, ENVELOPE, etc.) 

Of course, this technique works 
only from BASIC, not machine lan- 
guage. There are times when, for speed 
and efficiency, ML is required. Al- 
though conversion of ML routines ac- 
cessing the support chips is possible, it 
is apparently far from trivial. (The rnian- 
ual does not attempt to explain; it only 
hints that RAM/ROM bank-switching 
is involved, and that the banking sys- 
tem is similar to that of the Commodore 
Plus/4.) 

There is but one other limitation 
I've noticed with S'more. When writing 
or editing a BASIC program, the en- 
hanced BASIC often responds slowly, 
particularly with long programs. The 
cursor can take 1.5 to 2.5 seconds to 
reappear after you hit RETURN to enter 
a new line; it takes longer toward the 
beginning than at the end of a program. 
On the other hand, garbage collection 
purportedly is speeded up dramatically 
over 2.0 BASIC.

Works With 1 2a, Too 

These are the only problems I've expe- 
rienced working with the S'more car- 
tridge. Overall, S'more maintains a high 
degree of compatibility with BASIC 2.0 
(and its associated memory configura- 
tion), offers more than 50 percent addi- 
tional memory accessible to BASIC, 
and a greatly enhanced language. It 
makes working with the screen and 
sound a simpler task for BASIC 
programmers. 

In short, S'more is a cost-effective 
alternative to a Commodore 128 up- 
grade. {Cardco's literature describing 
S'more as a "bridge to the 128" is on 
target.) And even if you do decide later 
to acquire a 128, S'more works identical- 
ly on the 128 in 64 mode.

Heart Of Africa 



Neil Randall 

Recjuirements: Commodore 64 or 128 in 64 
mode; Apple ll-series computer with at 
least 64K RAM: or an Atari 400/800/ 
XL/XE with at least 48K RAM. Disk only. 



One of the truths in the entertainment 
industry is that anything popular will 
spawn many imitators. The field of 
computer games is certainly no excep- 
tion. The first hits were Space Invaders, 
then Pac-Man, and then Donkey Kong. 
Each of these games begat a host of 
imitations, few of which approached 
the quality of the original. Imitations 
are rarely as good as the things they 
imitate. 

Still, for every imitator trying to 
capitalize on the popularity of someone 
else's game, there's a designer trying to 
improve upon his own original design. 
This is not imitation — at least not what 
we normally think of as imitation. In- 
stead, the designer is making an honest 
effort to improve on a game concept. 
Much like an artist, who chooses a me- 
dium and produces work after work 
trying to perfect his use of that medium, 
the game designer invents a system, 
then produces game after game to de- 
velop the system to its fullest. As long 
as the system keeps improving, the en- 
terprise is justified. 

Such is the case with Ozark Soft- 
scape's Heart of Africa, published by 
Electronic Arts. Heart of Africa is an 
extension of the system pioneered in 
Ozark's own Seven Cities of Gold (re- 



viewed in the September 1984 issue of 
COMPUTE!). Far from an imitation, it im- 
proves on the original game and offers 
a fresh approach to a system that many 
people considered near-perfect already. 
Both games deal with exploration, but 
Heart of Africa gives us something 
more: a quest. 

In Search Of A Tomb 

Your quest in Heart of Africa is to find 
the lost tomb of Ankh Ankh, some- 
where in the middle of the Dark Conti- 
nent. You travel alone, buying supplies 
and tools wherever you can. As you 
cross the continent, you make discover- 
ies and try to obtain clues about the lost 
tomb from tribal chiefs. It's not hard to 
get information, but it's very hard to get 
useful information, and just as hard to 
stay alive. The perils are constant, from 
dying of thirst in the Sahara Desert to 
suffering a fata! bite by a poisonous 
snake. 

Like Seven Cities of Gold, Heart of 
Africa is entirely joystick-driven. You 
can put your feet up, lean back in your 
easy chair, and play the game without 
touching the keyboard. For further 
playability, the game offers a diary that 
continually updates itself. The diary is a 
graphically attractive series of pages 
that records special events. On the sur- 
face, it seems only a nice addition to the 
game, but in play it greatly eases 
record-keeping. Any exploration game, 
be it a text or graphics adventure, de- 
mands some keeping of records: map- 
making, recording conversations, 
jotting down clues. But Heart of Africa 
takes most of these out of your hands. 
The map is produced for you on the 
screen, and your observations, even 
conversations, are recorded in the dia- 
ry. You can read the diary at any point 
simply by loading it from disk. It makes 
the game extremely playable, especially 
for those who loathe keeping records, 

The Heart of Africa game screen 
shows a solitary figure marching across 
the map. As you walk, the map scrolls 
north, south, east, or west, shedding 
light on more and more of the Dark 
Continent. The map is constantly up- 
dated, and you can check it at any point 
during the game to see what you've 
already discovered. As you travel, you 
discover villages, mountain ranges, riv- 
ers, lakes, and, of course, if you work 
hard enough, the source of the Nile. 

Random events are sometimes 
positive, such as finding valuable 
caches left behind by previous explor- 
ers, as well as negative, such as encoun- 
ters with crocodiles, poisonous snakes, 
or rhinoceri. If you're equipped with 
the right weapons, you can normally 
stave off an attack, but you may be- 
come ill, fatigued, or very thirsty. You 



can paddle a canoe along the rivers and 
lakes, and you can even go over water- 
falls. The entire continent is yours to 
discover. 

Tribal Relations 

Perhaps the most impressive part of the 
game is the interaction with the tribes. 
As in Seven Cities of Gold, where coop- 
erating with the natives established 
your reputation, working with the 
tribes in Heart of Africa is difficult. Each 
tribe is different and each chief reacts 
differently to you. For some tribes, a 
few gifts will yield helpful information. 
For others, all the gold in the world 
seems insufficient. You can steal sup- 
plies by wielding your gun, but your 
reputafion will suffer. Or worse, you 
may catch a blow dart. The only way 
you can know how a tribe will react is 
to visit each village. If you do well and 
reward the chief, he'll tell you what else 
you might bring for more information. 
If you do poorly, you'll be drummed 
out of the village. 

The Heart of Africa manual consists 
primarily of the notes written by your 
predecessor, the person sending you on 
this mission. It describes each of the 
areas of Africa and the tribes therein. 
An impressive document for its sheer 
information, it is also vital for gaining 
clues about where you should go. It 
gives, for instance, translations of the 
tribal names for geographical points. To 
the natives, after all, Victoria Falls is not 
Victoria Falls. 

There is nothing easy about the 
game, but the difficulty comes from the 
situation, not in trying to learn the sys- 
tem. It is extremely easy to get across 
Africa, buying things, finding things, 
and giving things away, but it is very 
hard to gain useful information. Still, 
this is the game's strength. A poor game 
is difficult to learn and offers few re- 
wards. A good game is easy to learn 
and offers endless rewards. Heart of 
Africa, in this sense, is a very good 
game. 

Like Seven Cities of Gold, Heart of 
Africa is professional in every way. An 
excellent program, filled with surprises, 
the game is even more addicting than 
its predecessor. In Seven Cities of Gold, 
your rewards were the excitement of 
discovery and the favors of your mon- 
arch. Heart of Africa duplicates the ex- 
citement of discovery, but adds a 
desperate search for a lost tomb. This 
quest makes Heart of Africa an adven- 
ture as well as a simulation. 

Only One World To Explore 

One of the superb features of Seven 
Cities of Gold was its ability to create 
new worlds to explore. Players could 
never exhaust the game because the

program could make the world differ- 
ent each time. Surprisingly, Heart of 
Africa offers no such option. There are 
very good reasons for this — the time 
limit, and the quest itself — but perhaps 
the game would be even more complete 
if each Africa could be a new one. Dis- 
coveries are less exciting when you 
know about them beforehand. Further- 
more, the desperate feeling of being 
hopelessly lost, which Seven Cities of 
Gold presented so well, cannot happen 
here. If the game has a flaw, this is it. 

But the flaw is easily overcome. 
The romance of uncovering the Dark 
Continent captures the imagination to- 
day as much as ever, perhaps because 
there remain no large, unexplored land 
masses anywhere in the world. Heart of 
Africa lets you canoe down the Congo, 
meet a Zulu chief, and even get caught 
in a whirlpool near Stanley Falls. Khar- 
toum, Timbuktu, the Zambesi, Lake 
Tanganyika, Tangier — they're all there, 
waiting for you, ready to throw you 
many surprises. 

An almost flawless development of 
an already excellent game system. 
Heart of Africa should excite anyone 
who found Seven Cities of Gold even 
remotely interesting. Now, if only I 
could find Dr. Livingstone.

Todd Heimarck, Assistant Editor 

Reijuirements: Commodore 64 or 128; Ap- 
ple Il-series computer with at least 64K 
RAM; Atari 400/800, XL, or XE with at 
least 48K RAM; IBM PC/PCjr loith at 
least 128K RAM; Atari ST; Amiga; or

When the first thing vou see is the 
prompt LOGON PLEASE:, you want to 
reach for the rule book. But apart from a 
card that tells you how to load and run 
this game, there are no instructions. 
None at all. 

The premise behind Hacker is that 
you have stumbled across a telecom- 
munications system about which you 
know nothing. Being a good hacker (if 
that's not an oxymoron), you feel the 
urge to break in and explore. Try a few 
passwords; unless you're very lucky, 
none of them vvill work. After several 
failures, the system logs you off and the 
game ends. Or does it?' Some random 
characters appear on the screen, and

On the trail of corporate skullduggery in 
Actiuision's Hacker (Commodore 64 
version). 

the computer indicates that a security 
malfunction has occurred. You're in. 

The logon sequence is very realis- 
tic. Once, at the beginning of a game, 
someone walked into the room and 
watched me guess at a few passwords. 
Hearing that we were trying to get into 
an unknown system, which might be a 
government computer, and then seeing 
the security malfunction message, he 
got worried and reminded us that it's 
illegal to do what we were doing. That's 
the great appeal of Hacker, the feeling 
that you're doing something wrong and 
that you might get caught. Who knows, 
the FBI might even show up at your 
door and confiscate your computer. 

After you enter the system, the 
game becomes less realistic. On an ac- 
tual telecommunications system, every- 
thing would be straight text. The author 
o[ Hacker, in the interests of playability, 
has inserted some high-resolution 
graphics — unlike anything you'd see 
on a true bulletin board system or infor- 
mation service. However, the graphics 
do add a lot to the game. 

Remote-Control Robots 

You soon discover that you've come 
across a company involved in some sort 
of top-secret illegal project. This makes 
you feel less guilty about breaking into 
someone's system; you can seek out 
more information about this project 
and bring the culprits to justice. 

The company owns a vast network 
of subterranean tunnels, and their com- 
puter (to which you've gained access) 
controls robots that travel through the 
tunnels. By using the robot to explore 
the tunnel network and occasionally 
coming to the surface, you can accumu- 
late more details about the project. I'll 
say no more about the most effective 
techniques for winning because an im- 
portant part of the game is figuring out 
what's going on. 

The game play is almost identical 
in the versions 1 tried on the Commo- 
dore 64, Atari 520ST, and Amiga. The 
newer 16-bit machines (Amiga and ST) 
displayed slightly better graphics than 



the 64 because their screens have high- 
er resolution and more colors, The ST 
version works on both monochrome 
and color monitors. 

All things considered. Hacker is a 
worthy addition to your software col- 
lection, especially if you enjoy adven- 
ture games that require a bit of thought 
and an investment of time.

MasterType's 
Writer For Apple 

Stephen Levy, Book Editor 

Requirements: Apple He or Apple He with 
128K RAM ajid a printer. A Commodore 
64/228 version is scheduled for release 
this spring. 

Does the world really need another 
word processor? After all, MasterType's 
Writer does all the things most word 
processors do. Using direct commands 
or on-screen menus, you can write, 
edit, save, search, move, change, find 
and replace, and print just as you can 
with most full-featured word process- 
ing programs. 

So what makes MasterType's Writer 
special? If you're using it with an Apple 
Ilc/lle and an Imagewriter or Image- 
writer II printer, and if you need multi- 
ple fonts — including some very targe 
print styles — Writer is worth a closer 
look, even if you already have a word 
processor. With an Imagewriter or 
Imagewriter II, Writer can dump an ex- 
act copy of what's on the screen to the 
printer. Writer comes with eight fonts 
which can be loaded from disk and 
saved with your text. Among the styles 
are fonts that print very large type to 
the screen, quite suitable for use by 
young children just learning to read; 
proportionally spaced fonts of various 
sizes; and a style that is quite suitable 
for use on a monochrome monitor. 

Each font can be edited, so you can 
modify those provided or design your 
own completely new font. And once 
created, you can use the screen dump 
feature to duplicate text written with 
the new font on paper. 

If you have an Imagewriter II with 
a color ribbon, it's a simple matter to 
print text in color — simply underline 



April 1 986 COMPUTEl 65 



the text to be printed in green with a 
green line, blue text with the blue line, 
and so on. Again, you get an exact copy 
on paper. 

Some Nice Touches 

In addition to the fancy printing fea- 
tures, MasterType's Writer includes a 
few other extras. For example, the on- 
disk tutorial is well done and is a good 
introduction to using the program. 
Many people will return to the tutorial a 
second or third time even after they've 
started creating documents. 

With Writer's dual windows, you 
can work on two documents at the 
same time. You can have an outline in 
one window and the text you're writing 
in the other. If you've never used this 
kind of feature before, you might not 
miss it; but once you've tried it, you'll 
wonder how you got along without it. 
Writer's dual windows have the added 
advantage of allowing you to decide 
how much of the screen each window 
will occupy at any time. 

The manual is arranged in alpha- 
betical order with entries for most of the 
terms you're likely to look up. Usually a 
term refers you to the appropriate in- 
structions. If you're the type who likes 
to jump right in, you may find the 
manual a bit frustrating. But if you've 
tried the on-disk tutorial, you'll find the 
manual easy to use. And once you've 
been using Writer for awhile, an alpha- 
betically arranged manual makes locat- 
ing information a snap. 

Another powerful feature oi Master- 
Type's Writer is keyboard macros — you 
can recall a series of instructions with one 
or two keystrokes. Macros are especially 
handy for storing a series of often-used 
words. If you're writing a book report, for 
example, you might need to type the 
author's name or the book's title many 
times throughout the report. By defining 
these phrases as macros, you can type 
them simply by pressing two keys. 

Since macros can include program 
commands as well as ordinary charac- 
ters, you can create macros for such pur- 
poses as saving your document on disk. 
Then, whenever you want to save the 
current copy of your work, you just press 
two keys. 

Ease Of Use 

MasterType's Writer gives you the choice 
of using direct commands — usually ac- 
cessed by pressing CONTROL and one 
other key — or menus. Moving through 
the menus is easy and fast and saves you 
the trouble of memorizing commands. 
The menus are ideal for those new to 
word processing. Direct commands are 
faster for some functions, but for others 
save little more than one or two key- 
strokes. Most people will probably use a 



combination of both menus and direct 
commands. 

If you revise text often, one aspect of 
MasterType's Writer you may find an- 
noying is its text entry and editing line. 
Writer doesn't allow full-screen editing; 
all text must be entered and edited on the 
bottom line of the current window. That 
means you must press the cursor keys to 
move the line you wish to edit to the 
bottom of the window. This isn't a prob- 
lem when first entering text, but later, 
when editing, you can't see what comes 
immediately after the line you're trying 
to alter without continuously moving the 
text up and down. 

For whom is MasterType's Writer 
most suitable? It should be strongly con- 
sidered by those who have never used a 
word processor, teachers or students who 
plan to use it in schools, Apple users with 
an Imagewriter printer, or anyone who is 
unhappy with their current word pro- 
cessing program.

For The Atari ST 



George Miller 

Assistant Technical Editor 



Requirements: Atari ST with at least 512K 
RAM and a compatible printer. 

If you've been using ST Writer, the free 
word processor from Atari, but have 
been wishing for a program that sup- 
ports the drop-down menus and win- 
dows of GEM, then HabaWriter is for 
you.

aEnn: 



HabaWriter takes advantage of the 
GEM environment and includes all the 
features we've come to expect in a good 
word processor. Even more important, 
HabaWriter is easy to use. The instruc- 
tion manual isn't very long — only 46 
pages. If you're accustomed to other 
word processors, this may seem 
strange. Many programs have entire 
books devoted to their use, and some- 
times it's necessary to enroll in special 
classes to become really proficient. 
Even though the size of the HabaWriter 
manual is small, all the information 
you'll need is there. 

When you start up HabaWriter, you 
see a menu bar at the top of the screen 
with seven headings: Desk, File, Edit, 
Search, Format, Style, and Print. Just as 
on the GEM desktop, each menu in- 
stantly drops down when you point to 
it with the mouse. A click of the mouse 
button picks any selection on the cur- 
rent menu. Happily, HabaWriter is an 
intuitive program — the way you want 
to do something is probably the way 
HabaWriter requires you to do it. And 
the commands on the menus allow you 
to do just about everything you can 
think of. 

If you prefer not to use the mouse, 
the ST's ten special function keys let 
you access most of HabaWriiefs fea- 
tures. If you can't remember which key 




66 COMPUTE! April 1986 



does what, just press the Help key. A 
window opens on the screen to display 
a convenient chart of the function key 
commands. 

You can even use the Style menu 
to change the on-screen typeface from 
plain text to boldface or underline. Un- 
derlined text, however, is displayed with 
true underlining only on the mono- 
chrome monitor in high-resolution 
mode; it won't be underlined on the 
color monitor in medium resolution. 
But when you print your document, the 
text is underlined. (If you're using a 
printer that's capable of underlining, of 
course.) 

Multiple Windows 

HabaWriter lets you use the mouse for 
most functions that would require spe- 
cial commands with other word proces- 
sors. For instance, you can define a 
block of text simply by dragging the 
mouse cursor over it. To delete the 
block, you would then select the Cut 
option from the Edit menu. Even 
though the text is erased off the screen, 
it's still kept temporarily in a clipboard 
and may be pasted back into the docu- 
ment wherever you wish. 

HabaWriter uses screen windows 
for other purposes, too. You can open 
up to six windows to display more than 
one document at a time. Moving text 
between the windows is as easy as 
moving text within a document. And 
the size of the windows can be 
changed, just as with any GEM win- 
dow. Files can even be combined, al- 
lowing you to work with longer 
documents by using the Paste Docu- 
ment option. 

On-screen rulers let you easily set 
tab stops anywhere you want, and hori- 
zontal scrolling lets you create docu- 
ments as wide as 132 columns. (Only 
80 columns are displayed on the screen 
at a time.) 

Using options on the Format 
menu, you can center text on the 
screen, align it to the right or left mar- 
gins, or "justify" the text, just as profes- 
sionally typeset pages appear. 

HabaWriter's use of the GEM envi- 
ronment and its wide range of features 
make it one of the most attractive appli- 
cation programs to date for the Atari 
ST. You'll find it's a snap to give your 
correspondence and club newsletters a 
polished look— without much of the 
strain that's usually involved in learn- 
ing how to use a new word processor.

Loading And Linking 
Commodore Programs 

Part 2 



Jim Butterfield, Associate Editor 



Are you running out of memory for 
your programs? You don't necessarily 
have to buy a bigger computer. This 
month's installment shows how a 
technique called chaining lets you 
break up a large program into smaller 
parts to work on a common task. The 
technique applies to all Commodore 
computers, with either disk or tape. 



There are three major ways of con- 
necting programs together. Chain- 
ing allows several, programs to 
perform a job, each program con- 
tinuing the work that a previous 
program has started, load linking 
lets one program load another pro- 
gram, with the new program start- 
ing fresh on a new task. Overlaying 
lets a main program call in addi- 
tional subroutines, data tables, or 
graphics information. This month 
we'll discuss chaining. 

When one of a series of pro- 
grams has completed its share of 
the work, it may chain to a follow- 
ing program to continue processing 
the data. In effect, several programs 
group together to create a bigger 
program. On Commodore comput- 
ers, chaining works with disk or 
tape. It's more common with disk 
because the various programs can 
be brought in more quickly. If used 
with tape, you can arrange the pro- 
grams sequentially on the cassette 
so little time is lost in searching for 
the next program. We'll use disk for 
the following examples, but they 
can be readily converted' to tape. 



Why Chaining? 

The most obvious reason to chain 
programs is to save memory space. 
On small computers, there isn't 
enough room for big jobs. So the 
program is broken up into 
"chunks." Each chunk is small 
enough to fit into memory, each 
does a specific task, and together 
they do the whole job. Even on 
computers that seem to have lots of 
memory, you may need to resort to 
chaining to relieve congestion. For 
instance, even though the Commo- 
dore 64 begins with 38,911 bytes of 
free memory, arrays of data can 
quickly fill up much of this work 
area. 

Sometimes program flow is an 
important reason for chaining. If a 
statistical program has been pro- 
cessing some data, it might ask the 
user to choose from several options 
(draw a graph, print the data, etc.). 
Depending on which option is cho- 
sen, it may be convenient to call in a 
selected program to do the next job. 
In this way, the original program 
needn't be cluttered with code to 
cover all the possible options; in- 
stead, the options are handled by 
programs called in as required. 

Likewise, it's possible to write 
a program that starts up in several 
different ways. In one case, it might 
collect the data it needs from DATA 
statements. Another time, it might 
require input from the keyboard. 
On still other occasions, it might 
compute the data, read it from a 
file, or detect it by external sensors. 
No matter. We'll start up whatever 
"acquisition" program is appropri- 
ate, and when the data is ready to be 



processed, the computer can chain 
to a common processing program. 
Chaining is also a worthwhile 
exercise which can force you to 
break your programs into well 
thought-out modules. Your pro- 
gram can't leap about at will, since 
it can only reach whatever is in the 
current module; and you must tie 
up loose ends before you go to the 
next unit. Each time you chain, 
FOR-NEXT loops are scrapped, 
subroutine RETURNs are canceled, 
and the DATA pointer is RE- 
STOREd. You must make sure that 
these program areas are tidy before 
you chain, since they will otherwise 
be lost. 

Program Architecture 

A major advantage of chaining is 
that you don't lose variables between 
programs. Values, strings, and ar- 
rays that have been worked out by 
a previous program are carried 
through to the next program seg- 
ment. This is useful, but it also calls 
for careful handling — we don't want 
to mash these values inadvertently. 

Figure 1 shows how programs, 
variables, and arrays lie in memory. 
The point marked start-of-BASIC is 
where the program starts in memo- 
ry. Behind the program is a point 
called start-of-variables; beyond 
this point the computer stores vari- 
ables and arrays. 

You usually don't need to 
know the exact addresses of these 
memory points; the computer takes 
care of the housekeeping for you. 
String variables go into this area, 
too — although not the strings them- 
selves, just three-byte descriptors 



6a COMPUTEI April 19B6 



that say where the strings are locat- 
ed and how long they are. (More on 
this later.) 

Suppose you have a large pro- 
gram that chains to a smaller pro- 
gram. Figure 2 shows this 
happening. 

The variables don't move; be- 
hind the second program is wasted 
space that isn't used. This creates 
no problem when you run the pro- 
gram. However, after this kind of 
chaining has taken place, you 
should not SAVE the second pro- 
gram or you'll save the wasted area 
too (SAVE always stores from the 
start-of-BASIC point to just before 
start-of-variables). 

Here comes the problem. Let's 
take the reverse situation: a small 
program that chains to a larger one. 
Figure 3 shows the difficulty that 
results. 



The big program overwrites 
and destroys the variables created 
by the first, smaller program. To 
keep this from happening, our first 
program must be the biggest of the 
two, or at least the same size. 

If several programs are chained 
together, this rule always applies. 
The first program must be as big or 
bigger than any other program. It 
sets the start-of-variables point, 
and it must set it high enough so 
that all following programs won't 
run into trouble (for more infor- 
mation on this point, see "Commo- 
dore Program Chaining," COMPUTE!, 
December 1985). The Commodore 
128 in 128 mode doesn't need to 
worry about this problem. Since it 
keeps variables in a separate mem- 
ory bank, loading a new BASIC 
program can't harm them.

Chaining a longer program destroys the original program's variables. 



Strings And Descriptors 

As noted earlier, the variable and 
array area holds string information 
(the descriptors), but not the strings 
themselves. There are two places 
where the actual strings might be, 
and it's important to know about 
them. Say that your program con- 
tains a line like this: 
370 A$ = "GORILLA" 

When this line executes, the 
computer makes an entry in the 
variable table showing that there is 
now a variable called AS, that its 
length is seven characters, and that 
it is located at its present position in 
the program text itself. Except on 
the 128, the string is used from 
where it lies within the program. 
The computer decides that there's 
no point in making an extra copy of 
GORILLA; when it needs this 
string, it takes it from the BASIC 
program line. This type of string is 
called static because it never moves 
from its original location. Static 
strings can mean trouble if you 
chain programs: Since chaining re- 
places the original program text 
with a second program, all static 
strings — which exist only in the 
first program's text — are destroyed. 

There's a second kind of string, 
and that's the one we must use 
here. If a program contains a state- 
ment like INPUT A$, the string 
which is typed by the user must be 
stored somewhere. This is called a 
dynamic string; the computer stores 
it in a safe place where it won't be 
disturbed by chaining. 

Dynamic strings are created in 
two ways: by INPUT or GET state- 
ments and by string manipulations 
(LEFT$, RIGHTS, STR$, concatena- 
tion, and so on). It's simple to 
change a static string into a dynam- 
ic one. The statement A$ = "GOR- 
ILLA" -I- "" concatenates (adds 
together) the strings "GORILLA" 
and "". Since '"' is a null (empty) 
string, this statement really means 
"add nothing to the string GORIL- 
LA." Though the contents of the 
string don't change, the computer is 
convinced that we now have a new 
string which must be stored else- 
where in memory. 

Again, the Commodore 128 in 
128 mode doesn't need to worry 
about this problem. Strings are kept 
in a separate memory bank, and 



April 1984 COMPUTE! 69 



there's no such thing as a static 
string in 128 mode. 

Chaining Rules 

Let's summarize the rules for well- 
chained programs: 

• The first program in the chain 
must be as big or bigger than all 
subsequent programs. 

• Any strings you need to pass 
from program to program must be 
dynamic, not static. 

• If you use DEF FN definitions, 
redefine them in each program. 

• Arrays should be DIMension- 
ed only once, preferably in the first 
program. 

A Short Example 

Let's write a small series of pro- 
grams to demonstrate how this 
works. Our first program is called 
MAIN: 

100 IF N>0 GOTO 200 

The variable N can only be 
zero when we start, so we won't 
jump ahead. But if we ever chain 
back to this program, we'll take the 
branch to line 200. 

110 PRINT "SIMPLE GRADEBOOK DE 

MO" 
120 DIM N?(15),M(15) 
130 N=8 

For simplicity, we'll assume 
eight students. When the program 
runs, you can invent their names 
and numeric grades. 

140 FOR J=l TO N 
150 PRINT "STUDENT"; J; 
160 INPUT "NAME";N5(J) 
170 INPUT "GRADE";M{J) 
180 NEXT J 

Running the program at this 
point gives you data on eight stu- 
dents. If you ever chain back to this 
original program, it will branch to 
line 200 (remember the IF test in 
line 100). 

200 PRINT 

210 PRINT "DO YOU WANT TO — " 

220 PRINT "1. CALCULATE AVERAG 

E" 
230 PRINT "2. CALCULATE HIGH/L 

OW SCORES" 
240 PRINT "3. QUIT" 
250 PRINT 
260 INPUT "YOUR CHOICE (1-3)"; 

C 
270 ON C GOTO 300,310,3 20 
280 GOTO 260 
300 LOAD "C.AVG",8 
310 LOAD "C.HIL",8 
320 END 

Note that line 300 will not run 



into line 310, nor 310 into 320. The 
moment you perform LOAD within 
a program, the new program loads 
and runs immediately. Type this 
program and then save it as MAIN 
(don't save it under any other file- 
name). Now type NEW and enter 
program C.AVG as follows: 

100 PRINT 

110 A=0 

120 FOR J=l TO N 

130 A=A+M(J) 

140 NEXT J 

150 PRINT "AVERAGE SCORE, ";N;" 

STUDENTS=";A/N 
160 PRINT 
170 LOAD "MAIN", 8 

That's it. Check it closely and 
save it as C.AVG (again, the file- 
name is important; don't change it). 
Now type NEW and enter program 
C.HIL as follows: 

100 PRINT 

110 H=M(1):L=M(1) 

120 FOR J=l TO N 

X30 IF H<M(J) THEN H=M(J) 

140 IF L>M(J) THEN L=M(J) 

150 NEXT J 

160 PRINT "HIGH SCORE: ";H;" BY 

170 FOR J=l TO N 

180 IF H=M(J) THEN PRINT N$(J) 

190 NEXT J 

200 PRINT "LOW SCORE I ";L;" BY 

210 FOR J=l TO N 

220 IF L=H(J) THEN PRINT K5(J) 

230 NEXT J 

240 PRINT 

250 LOAD "MAIN", 8 

Again, check your typing 
closely and save the program as 
C.HIL to complete the set. Now 
load program MAIN and you're 
ready to try out chaining. Note that 
MAIN is definitely larger than the 
other two. If there's any doubt in 
your mind, add some extra REM 
statements to MAIN to make it 
bigger. 

Side Effects 

We mentioned earlier that the act of 
chaining causes certain things to 
happen. FOR-NEXT loops are 
scrapped, subroutine RETURNS are 
canceled, and the DATA pointer is 
RESTOREd. That makes sense: You 
can't RETURN to a program that 
has disappeared, for example. And 
occasionally, these side effects can 
be useful. For instance, can a pro- 
gram ever chain to itself? The an- 
swer is yes, but at first it's hard to 
see why you'd want to do so. 
What's the point of loading a pro- 
gram that's already there? The an- 
swer lies in these side effects. 



Sometimes a program gets 
stuck deep in a subroutine and can't 
find its way out. With good pro- 
gramming, this should never hap- 
pen. All subroutines should 
RETURN neatly, and if there's an 
error or similar anomaly, the infor- 
mation should be logged into a flag 
and detected at the appropriate pro- 
gram level. It's easy to give that sort 
of advice — but sometimes a pro- 
gram is deep within several nested 
levels of subroutines when the user 
commands, "Forget all this and 
take me back to the menu." Sensi- 
ble programmers know that you 
can't jump direcdy out of these sub- 
routines back to the main menu, 
and it's a long, long trail to back- 
track the whole way. 

In case of emergency, you can 
chain the program to itself. As it 
loads itself back in, it shakes off all 
the FOR-NEXT loops and subrou- 
tine levels and surfaces cleanly — 
with all variables in place — at the 
first statement. Just to show it can 
be done, we'll write a dreadful pro- 
gram that does just that. Please 
don't write programs this way: It's 
here just to illustrate a point. Re- 
member to type NEW before enter- 
ing this program.

Check the program and save it 
with the filename DEMO; be sure 
to use that filename, since the pro- 
gram uses it to load itself. 

DEMO is a program turned 
bad, and you should try not to get 
yourself into a similar problem. By 
the time this program reaches line 



70 COMPUTEI April 1986 



210, it's in a subroutine; at line 260, 
it's nested within a second subrou- 
tine. When line 270 discovers that 
the user wants to exit, the poor 
programmer doesn't know how to 
get out, GOTO 130 would be a very 
bad solution: Jumping out of the 
routine with GOTO instead of RE- 
TURN leaves unprocessed subrou- 
tine information on the computer's 
stack (which can eventually cause 
an OUT OF MEMORY error). What 
to do? 

The second-best solution 
(shown here) is to clean up the 
program with a chain to itself. The 
best solution is not to get yourself 
into this kind of mess in the first 
place. 

Chaining can be a useful and 
powerful technique. There are 
some rules to remember — especial- 
ly that of making sure the first pro- 
gram is the biggest — but in general 
it works quite well. Don't confuse 
chaining with loading, where one 
program loads and starts another. 
In this case, there's no passing of 
variables; the new program starts 
clean. We'll talk about loading in 
next month's installment. @

Adding 

System Power 

To ST BASIC 



Part 1 



Kevin Mykytyn, EditorJa! Programmer 



Atari ST BASIC lacks commands for 
certain operations such as reading the 
mouse pointer, but it's possible to fill 
in these gaps by calling system rou- 
tines with the VDISYS command. In 
Part I of this series, we'll examine the 
basics of calling VDI routines from 
BASIC and demonstrate a useful 
graphics routine. Part 2 will show 
how to read the mouse pointer with 
VDISYS and present a program for 
creating your own custom mouse 
pointers. 



If you own an Atari ST, you've 
probably heard at least two of the 
three-letter acronyms associated 
with the computer: TOS stands for 
Tramiel Operating System — a huge 
system program which, at the most 
fundamental level, allows the com- 
puter to function. And GEM stands 
for Graphics Environment Manag- 
er, a separate system program that 
handles the ST's graphics-oriented 
desktop. GEM, in turn, consists of 
three separate parts: the VDI (Virtu- 



al Device Interface), a low-level 
graphics interface that also handles 
mouse input; the AES (Application 
Environment Services), which uses 
the VDI to manage data and the 
desktop; and GEMDOS, which 
handles disk operations. 

Interesting, you may say, but 
what's the point? For most BASIC 
programming, you needn't worry 
about TOS, GEM, VDI, AES, or 
GEMDOS, any more than the aver- 
age driver needs to know exactly 
how an auto engine works. These 
system programs are the invisible 
machinery that makes everything 
else happen. 

However, as you may have 
discovered, ST BASIC lacks com- 
mands to do certain tasks, such as 
drawing a circle or sensing the posi- 
tion of the mouse pointer. That's 
what makes one of these strange- 
sounding programs — the VDI — an 
invaluable asset for the BASIC pro- 
grammer. The VDI holds a treasure 
trove of system routines which can 
do everything from drawing boxes 



April 1986 COMPUTEI 71 



and circles to rotating character 
fonts and manipulating raster 
blocks. With ST BASIC'S VDISYS 
command, you can access all of 
these routines — which compen- 
sates in large part for the missing 
ST BASIC commands, 

VDISYS To The Rescue 

In simplest terms, the VDISYS com- 
mand calls (activates) a VDI system 
routine to do a task that would be 
difficult or impossible to perform in 
BASIC. Furthermore, these system 
routines execute very quickly — a 
real plus when you're working with 
graphics. Whether executed in im- 
mediate or program mode, the 
VDISYS command always takes 
this general form: 

VDISYSM 

In this example a simple variable 
named .r appears in the parenthe- 
ses. It doesn't matter what value 
this variable represents; it's a dum- 
my parameter, needed only to satis- 
fy the syntax of the command. 
Don't try to enter this command 
yet — if you do, there's a good 
chance you'll see the mushroom 
cloud symbol that signals a system 
crash. A certain amount of prepara- 
tion is always needed before you 
execute VDISYS. 

When a VDISYS command is 
executed, control passes from your 
BASIC program to an internal VDI 
handler, which eventually passes 
control to the VDI routine itself. But 
first the VDI handler looks at cer- 
tain sections of the computer's 
memory, called parameter blocks. 
The data in the parameter blocks 
tells the handler which particular 
VDI routine you want to execute. 
There's also other information that 
the VDI routine itself will need. If 
you don't supply all the infor- 
mation needed to call a routine, the 
VDI handler can't carry out your 
request. 

VDI Opcodes 

The first thing you must tell the 
computer is which VDI routine you 
want to call. Each VDI routine is 
identified by a unique opcode num- 
ber. For instance, the VDI routine 
used in the program below has the 
opcode 11. This is a generalized 
shape-drawing routine. (There are 
hundreds of VDI opcodes and asso- 
ciated parameters, so we don't have 



room in this article for a listing. But 
you can find a 42-page list of select- 
ed VDI opcodes in COMPUTEl's ST 
Programmer's Guide, available from 
COMPUTE! Publications.) 

Once you know a VDI rou- 
tine's opcode number, that value 
must be POKEd into a special place 
in memory defined by the reserved 
variable CONTRL, Try typing 
PRINT CONTRL in immediate 
mode; even if you haven't given 
this variable any value, the com- 
puter prints a number on the 
screen. ST BASIC always prede- 
fines CONTRL along with several 
similar variables. The CONTRL 
variable represents an actual loca- 
tion in memory. 

Since the system automatically 
substitutes this location for the key- 
word CONTRL, you don't have to 
memorize a series of numbers or 
worry about where this parameter 
block really resides. To select VDI 
routine 11, for instance, you simply 
execute POKE CONTRL, 11. 

How Many Comers? 

Once you've POKEd the VDI op- 
code 11 into CONTRL, you must 
tell the computer how many verti- 
ces (corners) are needed to define 
the graphic shape you want to 
draw. Regular geometric shapes re- 
quire different numbers of vertices. 
A triangle, for instance, requires a 
minimum of three comers. A rect- 
angle, on the other hand, can be 
defined with only two — the upper 
left comer and the lower right one. 
Of course, a rectangle has a total of 
four corners, but the total is not 
what we're looking for. The com- 
puter cares only about the minimum 
number of vertices it takes to draw 
the shape in question. After you 
determine how many vertices are 
needed, that value is POKEd into 
the location defined by CONTRL 
+ 2. For example, in line 30 of the 
program below, the statement 
POKE CONTRL + 2,2 tells the com- 
puter that you want to draw a rect- 
angle (defined by only two 
corners). 

Notice that the second POKE is 
directed two bytes higher in memo- 
ry than the first. Now you can see 
the parameter block begin to take 
shape: It's simply a segment of 
memory where you place a collec- 
tion of values. The first byte of the 



parameter block is defined by 
CONTRL, and the remaining loca- 
tions are defined as even-numbered 
offsets above that starting spot 
(CONTRL +2, CONTRL +4, and 
so forth). 

The particular routine used in 
this program (termed a generalized 
drawing primitive) contains several 
subroutines (also called subfunc- 
tion$), each of which performs a 
different drawing task. To choose a 
subroutine, you must POKE its 
identifying number (called the 
primitive ID) into the location de- 
fined by CONTRL -I- 10. In this case 
we want to use the bar-drawing 
subroutine, whose primitive ID 
happens to be 1 . So in line 40 of the 
program, we POKE CONTRL + 10,1. 

PTSIN And INTIN 

The next step is to tell the VDI 
handler where to place the graphic 
shape. Recall that you told the com- 
puter earlier how many vertices it 
takes to define the shape. To posi- 
tion the shape on the screen, you 
must now tell VDI where to put 
each vertex. This is done by POKE- 
ing horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) 
coordinate values into a second pa- 
rameter block area. 

The second parameter block 
begins at a memory location de- 
fined by the reserved variable 
PTSIN {PoitUs Input). Again, you 
don't need to know the actual 
memory locations involved, since 
the computer keeps track of them 
for you. All you need to do is POKE 
the correct numbers into PTSIN 
(and even-numbered adjacent loca- 
tions, in some cases). 

Lines 50-80 of the example 
program perform this job by POKE- 
ing the bar's X and Y coordinates 
into memory. The X coordinate of 
the first point is POKEd into 
PTSIN; the first point's Y coordi- 
nate goes into PTSIN -I- 2; the X co- 
ordinate of the second point goes 
into PTSIN -H 4, and so on. Keep in 
mind that you must supply a pair of 
coordinate values for every point 
that you defined in CONTRL + 2. 

A third parameter block, be- 
ginning at the address defined by 
the reserved variable INTIN, is 
used to pass attribute values, if any 
are required by the current subrou- 
tine. The term attribute is a catch-all 
that can include many different pa- 



72 COMPUTEI April 1986 



rameters — colors, rotation values, a 
style index, or whatever — depend- 
ing on which subroutine is called. 
Since the subroutine used in this 
program requires no attributes, we 
don't need to POKE any values in 
this segment of memory. As a sig- 
nal to the VDI handler that no attri- 
butes ■ are involved, we must also 
POKE a zero into location 
CONTRL + 6; this location tells the 
system how- many attribute values 
to read from the INTIN parameter 
block. 

After all of the required values 
have been POKEd into memory, 
line 90 of the example program exe- 
cutes the VDISYS command, which 
calls the VDI routine and draws a 
bar on the screen. This may seem 
like an enormous amount of prepa- 
ration for such a simple task (which 
some other computers can do with 
a single BASIC statement). On the 
other hand, it's better than not be- 
ing able to draw a bar at all. You can 
cut down on the bulkiness of the 
code by writing setup subroutines 
that contain all the necessary 
overhead.

General Drawing Routine 

Though every VDI call requires 
several preparatory steps, each in- 
dividual step is easy to perform. As 
should be apparent by now, there's 
nothing mystical about the pro- 
cess — all you need to do is leave the 
right pieces of information in places 
where the computer can find them, 
then signal that you want the job 
done. The real work is done by the 
system itself. 

Though the general procedure 
is the same in every case, each VDI 
routine requires different types and 
amounts of information. One of the 



most useful VDI routines is the gen- 
eralized drawing primitive used in 
the example program. Table 1 sum- 
marizes the POKEs you need to call 

this routine. 



Table 1: Generalized 
Drawing Primitive 

POKE CONTRL, 11 

POKE CONTRL+2, number of vertices 
POKE CONTRL-l-6, number of attributes 
POKE CONTRL + 10, subfunction number 
(primitive ID) 

Again, CONTRL receives the 
opcode number of the VDI routine; 
CONTRL -I- 2 the number of verti- 
ces in the desired shape; 
CONTRL+6 the number of attri- 
butes (if any); and CONTRL +10 
the primitive ID for the subroutine 
you want. This particular VDI rou- 
tine is extremely versatile and can 
draw pie-shaped segments, ellip- 
ses, filled or empty rounded rectan- 
gles, and other graphic images, 
including text. Table 2 lists the 
primitive IDs for each of this rou- 
tine's subroutines.

To select a specific subroutine, 
find its primitive ID in the leftmost 
column of Table 2, then POKE that 
value into location CONTRL+10. 
Table 3 summarizes the POKEs 
needed to set up the second and 
third parameter blocks (PTSIN and 
INTIN). Remember, the value 
POKEd into CONTRL+2 (number 
of vertices) determines how many 
X-Y coordinate pairs you must 
POKE into the PTSIN parameter 
block. The X and Y coordinates for 
the first vertex go into PTSIN and 
PTSIN + 2; the second X-Y coordi- 
nate pair goes into PTSIN +4 and 
PTSIN +6, and so forth. 



Table 3: PTSIN And INTIN 
Parameter Blocks 

POKE PTSIN, X coordinate of firat vertex 
(rectangle) 
X coordinate of center 
(circle, ellipse) 
POKE PTSIN -(-2, Y coordinate of first 
vertex (rectangle) 
Y coordinate of center 
(circle, ellipse) 
POKE PTSIN + 4, X coordinate of second 
vertex (rectangle) 
X radius for ellipse 
POKE PTSIN + 6, Y coordinate of second 

vertex (rectangle) 
POKE PTSIN -1-8, radius (circle only) 
POKE PTSIN -!- 12, radius (circular arc or 
pie only) 

POKE INTIN, start angle for arcs and pies 
POKE INTIN -I- 2, end angle for arcs and 
pies 

To draw a circle, ellipse, arc, or 
pie-shape segment, POKE X and Y 
coordinates for the shape's center 
point into PTSIN and PTSIN+2. A 
simple circle requires a radius value 
in PTSIN + 8; arcs and pie shapes 
built from a part of a circle require a 
radius value in PTSIN + 12. To 
draw an ellipse, or an arc or pie 
shape built from part of an ellipse, 
POKE the shape's X radius in 
PTSIN + 4 and its Y radius into 
PTSIN + 6. 

Most of these subfunctions 
don't require any attribute values. 
To draw arcs or pie shapes, howev- 
er, you must POKE two attribute 
values into INTIN and INTIN +2 to 
define starting and ending angles, 
respectively. Since the angle values 
are specified in tenths of a degree, 
not in whole degrees, these param- 
eters can range from 0-3600. The 
starting angle specifies where you 
want the rounded portion of the arc 
or pie segment to begin, and the 
ending angle shows where that 
portion should stop. The statement 
POKE CONTRL +6,2 signals that 
you're passing two attribute values 
to the VDI. 

As you'll learn from experi- 
menting with these routines, 
VDISYS opens the gateway to a 
wide variety of graphics capabili- 
ties. Once you become familiar 
with the setup process, you'll prob- 
ably find yourself using VDISYS 
more and more. In part 2 of this 
article, we'll look at VDISYS in 
more detaU, and present a program 
that lets you create a custom shape 
for your ST's mouse pointer. ©

Mousify Your Applesoft Programs 

Part 2 



Part I of this series (COMPUTE!, 
March 1985) provided an Applesoft 
program allowing an AppleMouse, 
joystick, or game paddles to point to 
text on the screen. This month. Part 2 
demonstrates more advanced mouse 
operations such as defining a text area 
and deleting, copying, or restoring the 
defined text. The example programs 
run with either DOS 3.3 or ProDOS. 
Although a mouse works best, you can 
substitute a joystick or game paddles. 



Mouse-controlled programs must 
perform a number of functions in 
addition to simple pointing. The 
programs following this article pro- 
vide several of these important 
capabilities: 

• Define Text. Use the mouse to 
highlight a block of text, which can 
then be copied or deleted (typical 
word processing operations), 

• Copy Text. Copy highlighted text 
to a buffer without deleting it from 
the screen, 

• Delete Text. Delete highlighted 
text and save it in a buffer. 

• Insert Text. Restore previously 
copied or deleted text at a new 
point on the screen. 

• Cancel. Undo highlighting if you 
wish to abort a copy or delete 
operation. 

'Delete a Character. Delete the char- 
acter under the cursor. 

• Delete to End of Line. Delete text 
from the cursor to the end of the 
line. 

• Find Mouse. Locate the mouse 
interface. 

Getting Started 

Enter and save Program 1, which is 
an expanded and modified version 



Lee Swobodo 



of the program published in Part 1 . 
It works in either DOS 3.3 or Pro- 
DOS; if you're using ProDOS, 
change line 115 as shown here: 
115 fflMEM; 36352 

Program 2 creates a binary file 
named MOUSEY which contains 
machine language routines used by 
Program 1. The MOUSEY file creat- 
ed by Program 2 must be present on 
disk whenever you run Program 1. 
(It's not necessary to have Program 
2 itself on the disk with Program 1, 
just a copy of the binary file created 
by Program 2.) Be sure to save a 
copy of Program 2 so you'll be able 
to create new copies of MOUSEY 
whenever needed. 

Program 3 creates a short text 
file which we'll use in the following 
example. If you're using a joystick 
instead of a mouse, refer to the 
additional instructions under "Joy- 
stick Modifications" below. When 
you are ready to proceed, your disk 
should contain a copy of Program 
1, a file named MOUSEY (created 
by Program 2), and a file named 
TEXT (created by Program 3). 

When you run Program 1, the 
screen looks like this: 

ENTER INFORMATION 

FIRST NAME .... COMPUTE! 

LAST NAME READER SERVICE 

ADDRESS P.O. BOX 50950 

CITY DES MOINES 

STATE lA 50950 

ZIP 

TELEPHONE 1-800-346-6767 

COPY DELETE INSERT CANCEL 
ERASE QUIT DONE HELP 

This screen simulates what you 
might see in a simple address book 
program. We have introduced an 
intentional error by putting the zip 
code entry on the same line as the 



state entry. Let's correct the error 
for a quick demonstration of a few 
mouse features. Move the mouse 
cursor to the first number in the zip 
code, then press and hold the 
mouse button down while moving 
the mouse to the right. The com- 
puter highlights the zip code in in- 
verse video. Keep moving the 
mouse until all the numbers in the 
zip code are highlighted, then re- 
lease the mouse button. 

At this point, the highlighted 
text area has been defined. Now 
move the mouse pointer to the 
word DELETE in the strip menu at 
the bottom of the screen and press 
the mouse button. The computer 
erases the highlighted zip code 
from the screen. Don't worry — the 
information hasn't been lost. 
Whenever you delete text, the pro- 
gram stores it in a temporary mem- 
ory buffer. 

Now let's put the zip code data 
back where it belongs. Move the 
mouse pointer to the beginning of 
the next screen tine (directly under 
the I in lA), then press the mouse 
button. The computer moves the 
cursor to that line. Next, move the 
mouse pointer to the word INSERT 
and press the button again. The zip 
code data reappears in the desired 
screen area. 

Mouse Editing Functions 

Here is a more detailed description 
of the mouse-editing functions 
demonstrated in Program 1: 

Mouse pointer and text cursor. 

The rapidly blinking caret symbol 
(") is the mouse pointer, which you 
can move around the text screen 
with the mouse. When the pointer 
passes over a character, the charac- 
ter blinks rapidly. The flashing rect- 



74 COMPUni April 1986 



angle shows the position of the text 
cursor. When the cursor passes over 
a character, the character changes 
temporarily to flashing uppercase. 
There are three different ways to 
move the text cursor: 

• Move the mouse pointer to the 
spot where you want the text cursor 
to go, then press the mouse button. 

• Use the arrow keys as you would 
in Applesoft BASIC (the Apple 11 
uses CTRL-J and CTRL-K to move 
up and down, respectively). 

• Press RETURN to move the cursor 
to the beginning of the next screen 
line. If the cursor is already on the 
bottom line, it moves to the top. 
Pressing RETURN does not erase 
the text to the right of the cursor. 

Enter text. Text is entered as usual, 
by pressing any letter, number, or 
punctuation key. Lowercase letters 
are automatically converted to 
uppercase. 

Define text. Before text can be cop- 
ied or deleted, you must define it. 
Move the mouse pointer to the 
upper-left comer of the text you 
want to define, then press and hold 
the mouse button. While pressing 
the button down, drag the mouse 
pointer to the lower-right corner of 
the desired area. The computer 
marks the defined area by high- 
lighting every character with in- 
verse video, Now release the 
button: The area is defined, aiid 
you may proceed to the Cancel, 
Delete, or Copy options. 

Delete text. To delete a text area 
that you previously defined, move 
the mouse pointer to DELETE in 
the strip menu at the bottom of the 
text screen, then press the button. 
The computer blanks out the high- 
lighted portion of the screen and 
stores the first 200 characters of the 
defined area in a temporary buffer 
for later use. 

Copy text. To copy a text area that 
you have previously defined, move 
the pointer to COPY in the strip 
menu, then press the button. The 
computer stores the first 200 char- 
acters of the defined area in a tem- 
porary buffer. Unlike the Delete 
operation. Copy does not blank out 
the defined area. 

Insert text, To insert text that you 
previously copied or deleted, move 



the pointer to the spot where you 
want to insert text, then press the 
button to locate the cursor at that 
spot. Now move the pointer to IN- 
SERT in the strip menu and press 
the button again. The computer in- 
serts the text, using the text cursor 
position as a starting point. Note 
that the inserted text overwrites 
whatever else was in the affected 
area. You can insert only the most 
recently copied or deleted text. 

Cancel. If you define a block of text 
and then decide not to copy or de- 
lete it, move the pointer to CAN- 
CEL in the strip menu and press the 
button. The highlighting disap- 
pears, and the text is no longer 
defined. 

Editing keys. Press CTRL-D (or 
DELETE on the Apple lie and He) to 
delete the character under the cur- 
sor. The remaining characters in 
that line move one space to the left. 
You can also press CTRL-X to de- 
lete every character from the pre- 
sent cursor position to the end of 
the line. 

Try out the various editing 
functions. When you've tried ev- 
erything, move the mouse pointer 
to DONE in the strip menu and 
press the button. The demonstra- 
tion program ends with a routine 
that reads the current data directly 
from the video screen. 

Since the Copy, Delete, Insert, 
and Cancel commands are written 
in BASIC, they may take a second 
or two to complete if you define a 
large text area. Though BASIC can't 
perform such operations very fast, 
these routines are far easier for you 
to customize than if they had been 
written in machine language. If the 
slowness bothers you, just imagine 
how long it would take to delete the 
same amount of text with your 
trusty pink eraser. 

Joystick Modifications 

If you don't own a mouse, you can 
substitute a joystick. Delete lines 
120, 130, 10001-10090, 10200, 
20220, and 44000-44050 from Pro- 
gram 1; then add or modify the 
lines in Program 4. The joystick 
moves the mouse pointer around 
the screen, and the joystick button 
substitutes for the mouse button. 

Since the joystick was de- 
signed for a different purpose, its 



performance doesn't equal that of a 
mouse. But it costs a lot less. 

How Ttie Program Worlcs 

The machine language routine con- 
tained in the MOUSEY file simply 
highlights text by changing every 
character between the text cursor 
and mouse pointer to inverse video. 
All the other functions are carried 
out by the BASIC routines in Pro- 
gram 1. 

After you define a block of text, 
lines 35000-44050 act on the high- 
lighted area. The Copy routine 
(36000-36180) converts each char- 
acter in the defined area to normal 
video and stores it in a temporary 
text buffer. This buffer lies in loca- 
tions 775-1000 ($307-$3E8), a nor- 
mally unused region. 

The Delete routine (37000- 
37180) is similar to Copy and uses 
the same temporary buffer, but re- 
places each character in the defined 
area with a blank space. 

The Insert routine (38000- 
38100) moves text from the tempo- 
rary buffer back to the video screen, 
beginning at the current location of 
the text cursor. 

Lines 39000-40000 contain the 
Cancel routine, which aborts copy 
or delete operations. You can also 
cancel a definition by pressing any 
key. 

The routine at lines 41000- 
41070 deletes a single character; 
lines 42000-42060 erase all or part 
of the current line. 

Here are some other useful en- 
try points in the program (note that 
each of these routines ends with a 
GOTO rather than GOSUB):
